to God I'll be the fucking illest in this music\n\nThere is or there ever will be, disagree\nFeel free, but from now on I'm refusing to ever give up\nThe only thing I ever gave up's using, no more excuses\nExcuse me if my head is too big for this building\n\nAnd pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick\nPoppin' shit on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o-shit\nWho you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite\nYou stayed the same, 'cause cock backwards is still cock, you pricks\n\nI love it when I tell 'em shove it 'cause it wasn't that\nLong ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, flustered\n'Cause he couldn't cut mustard, muster up nothing\nBrain fuzzy, 'cause he's buzzin', woke up from that buzz, and now you wonder\n\nWhy he does it, how he does it, wasn't 'cause he had buzzards circle around his head\nWaiting for him to drop dead, was it\nOr was it 'cause them bitches wrote him off\nLittle hussy ass, 'cause fuck, guess it doesn't matter now, does it\n\nWhat difference it make, what's it take, to get it through your thick skulls\nIf this ain't, some bullshit people don't usually come back this way\nFrom a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place\nNow let these words be like a switch blade to a hater's rib cage\n\nAnd let it be known from this day forward\nI wanna just say thanks 'cause your hate is what gave me the

love him the same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic\nTell him how real he is or how high I am\nOr how I would kill for him to know it\n\nI cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back\nSo it's only right that I right\nTill he can march right into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up\nNow his career's Lebron's jersey in 20 years\n\nI'll stop when I'm at the very top\nYou shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop\n'Cause what goes up must come down\nYou going down on something you don't wanna see, like a hairy box\n\nEvery hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now\nUsed to have to eat the cat to get the pussy\nNow I'm just the cats meow, ow\nClassic cow, always down for the catch weight like Pacquiao\n\nY'all are doomed, I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me\nMy car starts itself, parks itself, and autotunes\n'Cause now I'm in the Aston, I went from having my city locked up\nTo getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick\n\nAnd now I'm fantastic,

he said, she said\nAin't it funny how rumors spread\nLike I know something y'all don't know\nMan, that talk is getting old\n\nYou better mind your business man, watch your mouth\nBefore I have to knock that loud mouth out\nI'm tired of talking, man, y'all ain't listening\nThem ol' dirt roads is what y'all missing\n\nYeah, I'm chilling on a dirt road\nLaid back, swerving like I'm George Jones\nSmoke rolling out the window\nAn ice-cold beer sitting in the console\n\nMemory lane up in the headlights\nHas got me reminiscing on them good times\nI'm turning off a real live drive and that's right\nI'm hitting easy street on mud tires, let's ride\n\nI sit back and think about them good ol' days\nThe way we were raised in our southern ways\nAnd we like cornbread and biscuits\nAnd if it's broke 'round here, we fix it\n\nI can take y'all where you need to go\nDown to my hood, back in them woods\nWe do it different 'round here, that's right\nBut we sure do it good, and we do it all night\n\nSo if you really want to know how it feels\nTo get off the road with trucks and four wheels\nJump on in and, man, tell your friends\nWe'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends\n\nI'm chilling on a dirt road\nLaid back, swerving like I'm George Jones\nSmoke rolling out the window\nAn ice-cold beer sitting in the console\n\nMemory lane up in the headlights\nHas got me reminiscing on

never tipped 'cause we needed the change\nI needed a break\nFor a sec I even gave up believing and praying\n\nI even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray\nThey say money is the root to the evilest ways\nBut have you ever been so hungry that it keeps you awake?\nMate, now my hunger would leave them amazed\n\nGreat, it feels like a long time coming, fam\nSince the day I thought of that cunning plan\nOne day I had a dream I tried to chase it\nBut I wasn't going nowhere, running man!\n\nI knew that maybe someday I would understand\nTrying to change a tenner to a hundred grand\nEveryone's a kid that no one cares about\nYou just have to keep screaming until they hear you out\n\nOh\nWritten in the stars\nA million miles away\nA message to the main\nOoh\nSeasons come and go\nBut I will never change\nAnd I'm on my way\nOh oh oh oh\nOh oh oh oh\nOh oh oh oh\nOh oh oh oh\nOh oh oh oh\nOh oh oh oh\nOh oh oh oh\n\nOh\nWritten in the stars\nA million miles away\nA message to the

just don't have the time to console her\nI can fall back in love when I'm older\nMy time to repent is not over.\n\nSo please save some forgiveness for me\nA man blinded by love can't think clearly\nWith four different lovers and 48 roses\nI need a confessional that never closes.\n\nSo please save some forgiveness for me\nA man blinded by love can't think clearly\nWith four different

in debt into his arms, it's sad\nCause I bet Brenda doesn't even know\nJust 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow\nBut oh, that's a thought-my own revelation\nDo whatever it takes to resist the temptation\nBrenda got herself a boyfriend\nHer boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end\nShe tried to hide her pregnancy from her family\nWho didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she\nWent out, and had a church of kids\nAs long as when the check came they got first dibs\nNow Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger\nBut no one seems to notice any change in her figure\nShe's twelve years old, guess she's havin' a baby\nIn love with a molester who's sexin' her crazy\nAnd yet in all, she thinks that he'll be with her forever\nAnd dreams of a world where the two of 'em are together,\nWhatever, he left her, and she had the baby solo\nShe had it on the bathroom floor, and didn't know so\nShe didn't know what to throw away, and what to keep\nShe wrapped the baby up, and threw him in a trash heep\nI guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries\nShe didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes\nNow the baby's in the trash heep, ballin'\nMama can't help him, but it hurts to hear him callin'\nBrenda wants to run away, Mama say\nYou making me lose pay, a social worker's here everyday\nNow, Brenda's gotta make her own way\nCan't go to her family, they won't let her stay\nNo money, no babysitters, she couldn't keep a job\nShe tried to sell crack, but ended up gettin' robbed\nSo now what's next, there ain't nothin' left to sell\nSo she sees sex as her way of leavin' hell\nIt's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain\nProstitute found slain, and Brenda's her name\nShe's got a baby\n\nBaby\n\nDon't you know she's

comb, it's up to your knees out there\nYou've really been grand, I'm thrilled when you touch my hand\nBut don't you see, how can you do this thing to me?\n\nThere's bound to be talk tomorrow, when you

pre-K\"\nTrippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?\n\nA bunch of stereotypes all in my head\nI remember doing the math like\n\"Yeah, I'm good at little league\"\n\nA preconceived idea of what it all meant\nFor those who liked the same sex, had the characteristics\nThe right-wing conservatives think it's a decision\n\nAnd you can be cured with some treatment and religion\nMan-made, rewiring of a predisposition\nPlaying God\n\nAh nah, here we go\n\"America the brave\" still fears what we don't know\nAnd \"God loves all His children\" is somehow forgotten\nBut we paraphrase a book

lately?\n\"Man, that's gay\" gets dropped on the daily\nWe've become so numb to what we're saying\nOur culture founded from oppression\nYeah, we don't have acceptance for 'em\nCall each other faggots behind the keys of a message board\nA word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it\n\"Gay\" is synonymous with the lesser\nIt's the same hate that's caused wars from religion\nGender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment\nThe same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins\nIt's human rights for everybody, there is no difference\nLive on and be yourself\n\nWhen I was in church, they taught me something else\nIf you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed\nAnd that holy water that you soak in has been poisoned\nWhen everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless\nRather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen\n\nI might not be the same\nBut that's not important\nNo freedom 'til we're equal\nDamn right I support it\nI don't know\n\nMary Lambert:\nAnd I can't change\nEven if I tried\nEven if I wanted to\nAnd I can't change\nEven if I tried\nEven if I wanted to\nMy love, my love, my love\nShe keeps me warm\nShe keeps me warm\nShe keeps me warm\nShe keeps me warm\n\nMacklemore:\nWe press play\nDon't press pause\nProgress, march on\nWith a veil over our eyes\nWe turn our back on the cause\n'Til the day that my uncles can united by law\nKids are walkin' around the hallway\nPlagued by pain in their heart\nA world so hateful\nSomeone would rather die than be who they are\nAnd a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all\nBut it's a damn good place to start\nNo law's gonna change us\nWe have to change us\nWhatever god you believe in, we come from the same one\nStrip away the fear, underneath it's all the

gotta double bag\nThe homie whipping chickens in his momma kitchen\nOn a mission, say he get it for son's tuition\nReal nigga's dreams coming to fruition\nStumble but I never fall leaning on my

feels different\nI only love her if her eyes brown\nPlay this shit while you play around with my crown\nKing H-O, y'all should know by now\nIf you don't know\nMillions on my wall in all my rooms\nNiggas couldn't fuck with my daughters room\nNiggas couldn't walk in my daughters socks\nBanksy bitches, Basquiats\nI ran through that buck 50, Live Nation fronted me\nThey working on another deal, they talking 250\nI'm holding out for 3, 275 and I just might agree\nEx D-boy, used to park my Beemer\nNow look at me I can park at my own Arena\nI only love her if her weave new\nI'm still a hood nigga, what you want me to do?\nBeen hoppin' out the BM with your bm\nTaking her places you can't go with your per-diem\nScreaming carpe diem until I'm a dead poet\nRobin Williams shit, I deserve a Golden Globe\nI take an Ace in the meanwhile\nYou ain't gotta keep this, it's just a freestyle\nFuck rap money, I made more off crates\nFuck show money, I spent that on drapes\nClose the curtains, fuck boy out my face\nI whip the coke, let the lawyer beat the case\nMurder was the case that they gave me\nI killed the Hermes store somebody save me\nStuntin' to the max like wavy\nOoh shit, stuntin' to the max I'm so wavy\nUsed to shop in TJ Maxx back in '83\nI didn't even know if it was open then\nI ain't know Oprah then\nHad the Xl80 bike, loud motor\nThey be like, damn when I'm coming through\nHad a grill in '88\nY'all niggas is late\nYou got all that right?\nI love this shit like my own daughter\nAnd spray these niggas baby just like daddy taught ya\nYoung, it's just different",

strength\nBe with four rich men and you bound to be the fifth\nLet's go\n\nI lost my daddy at a early age\nTold my mama, don't cry for me\nIf I trade tomorrow in for yesterday\nOh, how much different my life would be\n\nBut that's in my dreams, back to reality\nTryna get outta these street lights\nSo I won't have to live this street life\nNo more, no more\nNo more, no more, no\n\nJust gotta learn to deal with problems\nIf you're young and from slum with no father\nGot killed when you was little, still got mama\nShe try to tell him go to school but why bother\n\nWhen gettin' paid is the only way to solve 'em\nSeems the stars get farther and farther\nOut of my reach, out of these streets\nWill they ever make it big?\n\n'Cause I lost my daddy at a early age\nTold my mama, don't cry for

storm and rain I have no fear\nGotta keep holdin' on, hold my head up strong\nI know it won't be long\n(I'm livin' for the moment)\nUntil we'll be together again, fo real\n(If I could turn back the days)\n(Sure you could turn this back)\n\nHey, I was born with the hustle, never been a sucker\nDaddy wasn't in the crib, that made me tougher\nMomma struggled with the bills, that made me stuff up\nPowder in a sack which made me dumber\n\nNow I'm standin' on the corner, bag full of marijuana, crack\nPistol in my pocket for anybody who disrespect\nIn the trap chillin' where robbers and killers kick it at\n\nMy arms up in the feds for ten, they say I'm goin' in\nHa, bet that I'm a stretch that, backish to this rappers\nShow these niggas what I'm best at\nGet a lil' check, flip it and invest that\n\nYears later, oh now you see what my heads at\nLike meals chasers, we be everywhere the bread at\nYou keep on hatin', you'll be layin' where the dead at\nYou rappers suckers, you can tell them that I said that\nIf nothin' else but the hustle, you gon' respect that\n\nI lost my daddy at a early age\nTold my mama, don't cry for me\nIf I trade tomorrow in for yesterday\nOh, how much

yesterday is over\nIt's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over\n\nBut you promised her, next time you'll show restraint\nYou don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game\nBut you lied again, now you get to watch her leave out the window\nGuess that's why they call it window pane\n\nRihanna:\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's alright because I like the

things, that we didn't mean\nThen we fall back into the same patterns, same routine\nBut your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me\nBut when it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby please\n\nCome back, it wasn't you, baby it was me\nMaybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems\nMaybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano\nAll I know is I love you too much to walk away though\n\nCome inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk\nDon't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk\nTold you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball\nNext time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the dry wall\n\nNext time, there will be no next time, I apologize\nEven though I know it's lies, I'm tired of the games\nI just want her back, I know I'm a liar\nIf she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire\n\nRihanna:\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn\nBut that's alright because I like the way it hurts\nJust gonna stand

they say \"yo\"\nSo do the terrapins and the ducks\nOne of them fell off a log, was hilarious\nI bought a coffee and sat the grass\nRemembering us this time last year\nWe fell in love, unmistakable\nWho woulda thunk that Akira was capable?\nCoupla dates turn to something amazing\nThe winter turned spring then the summer was blazing\nMy middle name's Jan, maybe yours could be

they hustlin you\nI'm a gambler baby, I'm gon do what the old heads taught me\n\nFive Hundred on the line and I'm looking for a 10\nBut I know exactly know how to find a bitch again\nI buck'em off the table, a 4 and a 6\nMoney up, money down, who gonna fade me tricks\nCame a 6, and what I left with, hush it\nIt's a secret; hustlas don't discuss it\nBrush the dust off my britches when the dice game finished\nSometimes you gotta lose, man that just the business\nI done left the rent to the dice game, the water and lights\nMy old lady bout to hoop and call it a night\nMy last two hundred, and I'm bout to let it ride\nLet'em roll, came out a 4 and 5\nMy points 9, I'm working, 8, 10, I'm searchin\nWell here goes a 4 and a 5\nWell a 6 and a 3 but either way it's a 9\n\nThe sink in a drought and I'm tryin' to survive\nCable off, TV only picks up five\nWhite sneakers, damn near look off-white\nAnd I'm still using heavy starches, them shit is all right\nMy whole life I'd have trouble stayin focused\nBut I never gave up and never stopped copin\nPits in the yard, a bucket in the driveway\nI'm gonna turn that bitch into a new truck one day\nSomeday, 'cause I'm gonna get out here and work until\nI get a mil, fuck the lotto and a record deal\nIt's real, when you don't even know when your gonna get your next meal\nEven though when you straight, you still feel like you on them X pills\nCan't sit still, you pace back and forth\nCross the floor until you can't take no more\nBut I'ma be back, believe that, like my big homie E-Mack\n...The muthafuckin Southside!\n\nI took sixteen zips of that Mexican red\nWeighed my quarters at five, charged an arm and a leg\nBusted heads, this move dealt me a new hand\nThe eight I invested was now two grand\nMet a busta at a club and told him I was the man\nMet up with him, sold him a quarter ki of sand\nA young dude, my mentality was like fuck dude\nWe like some pit puppies fightin over dog food\nIn school I sold candy a quarter a piece\nI made my money off three and the rest was all me\nIn life I fucked a couple of good connects up\nSo if you in the car with me keep ya heads up\nWorked so hard but couldn't stack no bread up\nFinally said fuck it 'cause I just got fed up\nThe money I owe you, you can chop that boss\nBecause I don't think you got the balls to come knock Stak off", "youtube_link":

be 60 years old, my daddy got 61\nRemember life and then your life becomes a better one\nI made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once\nI hope my children come and visit, once or twice a

covered in a cloak\nI'm smothering the southern bay\nMother to other ways\nBlasting rays like an ambassador from outer space\nHovering to cover days\nBrother of the ricochet\nCrenshaw chainsaw

rapping at your door\nIs standing in the clothes that you once wore\nStrike another match, go start anew\nAnd it's all over now, Baby Blue", "youtube_link": "http://youtube.com/watch?v=z6-QdP4ZupM",

Aye Dub! Aye Dre! Aye Irv! you know it's all year right? Hah! I'm sitting here in the middle of New York City, the night before I gotta turn my second album in, higher than a motherfucker, drunker than a motherfucker, with my boys, and I'm thinking, damn, man 5 years ago, we were dead broke chilling in Cleveland everyday, and the next thing you know, people are calling us about record deals. And you know, the crazy part is, Ashleigh rented this white Nissan Altima for me and Slim so we could drive out to New York. I think she had to some work some shit or something, so she couldn't go so we were gonna go out there and see what these labels were talking about. And I'm driving us there, but my license's suspended so I tell Slim, I'm like \"Yo, I gotta pull up before we get to New York and switch, so you can drive in case we get pulled over\" 'cause we got pulled over the last time we went there. But you know, he had a license so it made sense for him to drive so cut to like 7 and a half hours later, I'm pulling over in this emergency lane and right as I'm opening the door to switch with Slim, boom! This fucking car going full speed on the highway swerves off the road and smashed into us. Yo, I swear to God I woke up half my body's laying outside the car in the ditch, like 15-20 feet away from where we just were. The car was totalled, the windows were smashed, it was cold as fuck, it was raining outside, but we were actually okay. I mean, my boy had to go the hospital you know the ambulance came and shit, he ended up being alright, but our meeting's with the record label started at 2 and we didn't have no car, and now we were stuck in a fucking hospital in New Jersey. So this dude that, I ended up partnering with later on, his name's James McMillan, he comes and gets us to these meetings and shit, somehow, someway. I don't know if it was just because we just got into a crazy car crash and could've died a couple of hours ago but I'm in there and like you know I'm not feeling this shit man I'm not feeling this record label shit and we drove back to Cleveland. Now I'm back in Ashleigh's mom's basement, I'm thinking about life, you know, I'm on a shit ton of vicodin 'cause the doctors at the hospital you know gave us something 'cause we got into that car accident and Ashleigh runs downstairs and she's like \"Yo, yo, Kells, Kells, you're not gonna believe who wants to talk to you right now.\" I'm like, \"who?\" She's like \"He's gonna call you in 30 seconds.\" Now I guess, when I was in New York, I had made some kinda noise 'cause this dude named Byron who ended up becoming my manager later on took this video I had called \"Chip off the Block\" over to Bad Boy and showed Harve Pierre and Harve Pierre went and showed that vid to a guy named Puff, so I answer my phone, depressed, down, fucked up on vicodin and I hear: \"Please hold, I have Mister Sean Combs for you.\" I said, god damn, life's about to change, man, I felt it. And sometimes that's all it takes, it's just that feeling you know what I mean. I knew I was gonna be here, and now I'm here\n\nFeel that, uh\nLace up, Kells\nLace up, Kells\nFarewell, yeah\nThis that shit you bob your head to\nThis that brand new instrumental\nI heard he puts

made\n\nBut there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark\nYou should know you're beautiful just the way you are\nAnd you don't have to change a thing\nThe world could change its heart\nNo scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful\nAnd you don't have to change a thing\nThe world could change its heart\nNo scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful\n\nShe has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving\nYou know, covergirls eat nothing\nShe says \"beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything\"\n\"What's a little bit of hunger?\"\n\"I could go a little while longer,\" she fades away\nShe don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it\nOr that beauty goes deeper than the surface\nSo to all the girls that's hurting\nLet me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer\nThe light that shines within\n\nThere's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark\nYou should know you're beautiful just the way you are\nAnd you don't have to change a thing\nThe world could change its heart\nNo scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful\n\nNo better you than the you that you are\nNo better you than the you that you are\nNo better life than the life we're living\nNo better life than the life we're living\nNo better time for your shine, you're a star\nNo better time for your shine, you're a star\nOh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful\n\nAnd there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark\nYou should know you're beautiful just the way you are\nAnd you don't have to change a thing\nThe world could change its heart\nNo

time\nThere's so much water, so close to home\n\nSo this is what they did,\nThey carried her downstream from their fishing\nBetween two rocks they gently wedged her\nAfter all they'd come so far, it was late\nAnd the girl would keep; she was going nowhere\nThey stayed up there fishing for two days\nThey reported it on Sunday when they came back down\nThere's so much water, so close to home\n\nWhen he holds me now I'm pretending\nNothing is working inside\nAnd behind my eyes, my daily disguise\nEverything's turning to white\n\nThe newspapers said that the girl had been strangled to death and also molested\nOn the day of the funeral the radio reported that a young man had been arrested\nI went to the service a stranger\nI drove past the lake out of town\nThere's so much water, so

which is something else I crave\nNow she goes out with another, I've heard he's called Dave\nHe operates machinery and says he loves her well\nBut deep down she still loves me, I can tell\n\nThrowing

apartment\nGreat statement, without delayment, away and went\nSaved to get a house on one of them low down payments\nBut an idea concocted his stock\nWhy don't we try and turn this money over on the drug tip\nSo he gave his man a shriek and excitement\nDidn't know his peeps were under secret indictment\nSick of the path that'll get you hung by the neck\nSent him back up north to do a super long stretch again\nBlack folk, you know the half, don't laugh, it's...\n\nJust another case about the wrong path\n\nWell, this ain't funny, so don't you dare laugh\nIt's just another case about the wrong
