"Well, the truth, well, it hurts to say\nI'm gonna pack up my bags and I'm gonna go away\nI'm gonna split, I can't stand it\nI'm gonna give it up and quit, ain't never comin' back\n\nBroke up before I get to go and I got to say\nI know you used to love me but that was yesterday\nAnd the truth I won't fight it\nWhen the love starts burnin' you got to do what's right\n\nWhoa, lover, lover, lover\nYou don't treat me no good no more\nWhoa, lover, lover, lover\nYou don't treat me no good no more\n\nWell, the truth, yeah, it hurts to say\nI'm gonna pack up my bags and I'm gonna go away\nI'm gonna split, I can't stand it\nI'm gonna give it up and quit, ain't never comin' back\n\nBroke up before I get to go and I got to say\nThere was a time, oh, woman when you used to shake it for me\nBut now all you do is treat me cold\nAin't gonna take it no more, gonna walk out the door\n\nLover, lover, lover\nYou don't treat me no good no more\nNo good no more, more, more\nLover, lover, lover\nYou don't treat me no good no more\nYea, yeah, yeah\n\nWell, I went with you on a starry night\nAnd I'm hurtin' too bad 'cause you don't treat me right\nOh, woman oh, woman, you know I love you so\nBut you're just so mean to me, baby, I'm walkin' out the door\n\nLover, lover, lover\nYou don't treat me no good no more\nNo good no more, more, more\n\nI know you used to love me in every way,\nBut now I'm givin' up and I'm tired of cryin', babe\nI can't stand it no longer, it hurts me to say\nBut I'm packin' up my bags and goin' far away\n\nLover, lover, lover\nYou don't treat me no good no more\nLover, lover, lover\nYou don't treat me good no more\n(Treat me good no more)\n\nLover, lover, lover\nYou don't treat me good no more\n(Treat me good no more)\nLover, lover, lover\nYou don't treat me good no more\n(Treat me good no more)\n\nLover, lover, lover\nYou don't treat me good no more", "youtube_link": "http://youtube.com/watch?v=-q0LE3gtUn8", "views": 14723426, "likes": 80102,
