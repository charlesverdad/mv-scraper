ever felt before\nThere's somethin' 'bout a kiss that's gonna lead to more\n\nAnd there's somethin' 'bout a truck in a field\nAnd a girl in a red sundress with an ice cold beer to her lips\nBeggin' for another kiss\nAnd there's somethin' 'bout you and me and the birds and the bees\nAnd Lord have mercy it's a beautiful thing\nAin't nothin' 'bout it luck, there's somethin' 'bout a truck\n\nSomethin' 'bout a creek, around 2 a.m.\nAfter a few of those beers, you wanna dive on in\nYou don't need no clothes, so just hang 'em on a limb\nThere's somethin' 'bout a creek around 2

your eyes \n\nLike a watercolor painted sky \nYou'll think heaven's doors have opened \nYou'll understand why God made those fly over states \n\nTake a ride across the Badlands \nFeel that freedom on your face \nBreathe in all that open space \nAnd meet a girl from Amarillo\n\nYou'll understand why God made... \nYou might even wanna plant your stakes \nIn those fly over states \nYeah \n\nHave you
