you\nAlways ride, whatever the plan is\nTo the end, even if I led us into an ambush\nEven if we robbed the First National and cops caught us red handed\nThey're coming at us, and we're trapped, put our backs up\nAgainst the wall, and it's too tall\nYou catapult me or hold the ladder for me\nStay back to get captured, take the fall\nYou make it all worth it\nBaby doll, you're perfect the way you are\nAccidents happen\nAll I know is you love me, that's really all that matters\nAnd any who cross our paths are just collateral damage\nAt your side, got your lateral, back, your front, diagonal\nBackwards, blackbirds, we attack like animals\nWhen they threaten what we have it's a natural reaction\nYou lay a bitch flat on her back in a second flat for me\nWho tries to take your man from you\nIt's blasphemy, it's another casualty, you'll go whatever route\nWhatever you have to do, you blast for me, I never doubt\nBack to you\n\nYou gon' make make me a believer, ah\nEven if that shit ain't true, ah, ah\nYou gon' make me commit murder\nBaby, I'd kill for you", "youtube_link": "http://youtube.com/watch?v=o4biOuKD76I", "views": 110867, "likes": 2077, "dislikes": 23, "updated":

beautiful mind, how is our beauty defined?\nIs it for you to decide, is it my duty to die?\nNo matter how I'm remembered, just let me be remembered\nKells\nYeah, forever young, though\nAlways be those

don't make you...\n\nI'm a huslta baby, I take chances everyday\nI'm a gambler baby, how can I win if I don't play\nI'm a hustla baby, you either hustlin them or they hustlin you\nI'm a gambler baby, I'm gon do what the old heads taught me\n\nFive Hundred on the line and I'm looking for a 10\nBut I know exactly know how to find a bitch again\nI buck'em off the table, a 4 and a 6\nMoney up, money down, who gonna fade me tricks\nCame a 6, and what I left with, hush it\nIt's a secret; hustlas don't discuss it\nBrush the dust off my britches when the dice game finished\nSometimes you gotta lose, man that just the business\nI done left the rent to the dice game, the water and lights\nMy old lady bout to hoop and call it a night\nMy last two hundred, and I'm bout to let it ride\nLet'em roll, came out a 4 and 5\nMy points 9, I'm working, 8, 10, I'm searchin\nWell here goes a 4 and a 5\nWell a 6 and a 3 but either way it's a 9\n\nThe sink in a drought and I'm tryin' to survive\nCable off, TV only picks up five\nWhite sneakers, damn near look off-white\nAnd I'm still using heavy starches, them shit is all right\nMy whole life I'd have trouble stayin focused\nBut I never gave up and never stopped copin\nPits in the yard, a bucket in the driveway\nI'm gonna turn that bitch into a new truck one day\nSomeday, 'cause I'm gonna get out here and work until\nI get a mil, fuck the lotto and a record deal\nIt's real, when you don't even know when your gonna get your next meal\nEven though when you straight, you still feel like you on them X pills\nCan't sit still, you pace back and forth\nCross the floor until you can't take no more\nBut I'ma be back, believe that, like my big homie E-Mack\n...The muthafuckin Southside!\n\nI took sixteen zips of that Mexican red\nWeighed my quarters at five, charged an arm and a leg\nBusted heads, this move dealt me a new hand\nThe eight I invested was now two grand\nMet a busta at a club and told him I was the man\nMet up with him, sold him a quarter ki of sand\nA young dude, my mentality was like fuck dude\nWe like some pit puppies fightin over dog food\nIn school I sold candy a quarter a piece\nI made my money off three and the rest was all me\nIn life I fucked a couple of good connects up\nSo if you in the car with me keep ya heads up\nWorked so hard but couldn't stack no bread up\nFinally said fuck it 'cause I just got fed up\nThe money I owe you, you can chop that boss\nBecause I don't think you got the balls to come knock Stak off", "youtube_link": "http://youtube.com/watch?v=QJgzvAYgb4Q", "views": 2580925, "likes":
