Cause lately I've been close to the fuckin' edge, so many suicidal thoughts in my fucking head\nI'm so depressed and I feel ashamed, popping pills everyday so I don't feel the pain, but I don't say shit, I don't ever say shit, cause every time I try it's like I hear the same shit\n\"Jay, you gon' be just fine, you just gotta give it time, find your peace of mind.\"\nBut you don't understand the tears that I shed, sometimes I just cry only wishing I was dead. And I'm sorry, I'm truly sorry for the way I feel\nI'm so lost in my dreams don't know what is real. This poetry is all I have when I feel deprived, I grab my pad and my pen, and I feel revived\nI can't decide what the fuck am I here for, I'm doing what I love but my heart's still sore. I still battle with depression on a daily. I see my own reflection, and I swear I fuckin' hate me, I said I swear I fuckin' hate me\nGot a big heart, but my heart's slowly breaking. Chasing all my dreams, but I don't know where it's gon' take me\nTired of being broke, gotta start acting shady. Making dirty money, yo, this shit is so degrading. Mamma, know I'm sorry for this route in which I'm taking, I ain't fuckin' proud of these decisions that I'm making, but I'm desperate for some answers, why my heart is always aching\nIf you hear me Lord, talk to me, all the sins from my past have been haunting me, I'm so scared of the future so I stay stuck broken into pieces, yo, my spirits all taped up\nI came up, but it feels like I'm coming down. Pool full of liquor, swim till I fuckin' drown. That's the only way I know how to crack a smile, taking shots till I vomit and I'm passing out... When I'm sober, I just feel afraid, I don't know if I'ma live to see another day. I'm tryin' to stand but I feel like I'm about to cave, I'm so trapped in my mind like a fuckin' slave\nSo much weight on my chest, got me feeling tired. Plague in my soul, swear it's like a wildfire, like a wildfire spreading everywhere. Take a look into my eyes, see the pain, oh, there's plenty there. See the pain, yo, there's plenty there\nI don't know if they really care. Where is love is it anywhere? And if it is, yo, it's really rare\nCan a broken heart be repaired? Can a broken heart be repaired? Can you tell me all I need to know. Or is it lost in our own despair?\nCan you tell me all I need to know. Can you tell me all I need to know, or is it lost in our own despair?", "youtube_link": "http://youtube.com/watch?v=0Gl2QnHNpkA", "views": 163975285, "likes": 539682, "dislikes": 19944, "updated":

the mental lox\nFundamental Soundgarden verbal Black Hole Sun\nAt the flicks getting sucked in the back row\n\nLungs filled, smokey like the pork shoulder\nLash out, one second in the fourth quarter\nTriple penetrate, pussy meat I renovate\nFuck 'em like a dog and leave 'em twisted like my mental state\nOff the deep end, snorkel in a river\nI take it back to Walkman's and tape decks\nIn great neck, having great sex\nI didn't even have a hair on my face yet\nMy feet were always classic though\nPinky up, classy flow\nIf you know me, you know never to pass me blow\nStraight shitting on these songs so the grass can grow\nTill we sitting in the garden, smoking\nListening to Marvin go\nI treat the shit just like a title fight, you sparring\nSoon a damn Ferrari, sex and models straight

me\n\nNo, I ain't hinting for sympathy\nI'm used to dealing with apathy\nThe scars on my wrists may seem like a crime\nJust wish me better luck next time\n\nSo what if I died a thousand deaths?\nYou

arm\nLooking like a vagabond Caliber kills her with the charm\nAs compensation for the cash flow\nI approached the honey mad slow\nHoping in a moment we could dance slow\nBut before I could advance yo she said no\nMumbling something about the club scene and assholes\n[I] stayed humble, extended my hand\n[She was] so receptive to the fact when I approached her I was such a gentleman\n[I] told her that's just how I am\nWould you consider this dance?\n[She] said, \"My skirt's too short, maybe if I wore pants\nPlus the heels, make it harder to move.\"\nTold her, \"Disregard the feeling, only part required is your waist to groove.\"\n[She] grinned slightly. Feeling she begins to like me\nI converse politely hoping she'd invite me but\nInstead, I got a hole in my head\nSomething bout' getting out of bed and dreading work because\nHer boss makes her fed\nDead the conversation\nHad to see if she was with it, then within an instance\nI began to feel resistance\nDidn't budge, I got bored\nLunging for the dance floor\nShe's indulged in conversation, that's not what I'm here for\nTherefore\nI said, \"I'm about to slide, I get the picture.\"\nShe said, \"I don't wanna' dance but it's nice talking with ya.\"\nLook, clubs are for dancing\nCoffee shops are for discussion\nAnd if we party now maybe tomorrow we could luncheon\nInvoluntarily I move when I hear the percussion\nMan! Stand still, paying twenty bills for nothing\nOut of the question\nIrregardless of your beauty you're making me regret that I said pardon of\nExcuse me\n(Truly) your beauty's dazzling but I'm about to peel\nToo elegant to sweat is something\nCaliber could never feel\n\nDressed to kill, low cut chest revealed\nClassy still you've got a lot of sex appeal\nBut you're such a Wallflower you could dance in heels\nYou're trying to chill, I'm trying to see your dancing skills\n\n(Quartermaine)\nListen sugar peeped your style a mile away\nGracious I might say exotic like a wild bouquet\nI only need your time of day and maybe a\nFew seconds to display the game (huh)\nNot in the mood?\nIn the cut you claim you want to lay, but\nI don't play this game to lose\nQ don't run away (NAW)\nI move with a straight approach, laced in [po]lo\nB-boy arrogant pose\nTrying to get the last drag off the hash in the roach\nMy wardrobe, it shows that I ain't trying to boast\nBut hopefully you and me we get to whine real close\nMost of the time I play it cool\nDon't even sweat these shorties cause\nSometimes you wave hi they think you're getting naughty\nBut you Miss, you're unlike all these little girls that bore me\nI'm trying to get you off the wall and get on the floor see\nIt's curiosity that's got this cat frisky\nHot under the collar feeling tipsy off the whisky\nMaximum return on my interest cause my business never risky\n[I'm] spitting in tongues until you get me\nWhy don't you let me gently hold your hand sexy\nAnd spin it out [of] control like a 430SC?\nI think I see a spot in the corner\nWhere we can work it out sweat dripping like sauna\nI wanna' push your body to the limit\nRepetitions infinite\nWe gonna' dance or not?\nLet's rock before the song finish", "youtube_link":

limit, huh?\nI'm living like it's my last day\nSmoke as if there's not already 27 roaches in the ashtray\nSmile as if no one hated at all\nAs if anyone understood anytime I evolved\nTell me what do you do when your dreams come true?\nBuy a Bentley and look just like you?\nHow am I supposed to write a song when I'm famous\nAnd all the pain is created?\nI need to overdose on inspiration\n27\n\nWhy don't you just go home?\nWell, I can't right now, I'm a rolling stone\n\nAnd if I must go, and fly away\nAnd kiss my baby girl goodnight\nAnd if this really is goodbye\nThen let's set the city on fire\nCan you take me higher?\nNow, can you take me higher?\nNow, can you take me higher?\nCan you take me higher?\n\nIf I must go, die at 27\nThen at least I know I died a legend\nWill you roll and ride like we're together?\nAnd keep the vibe alive forever\nKeep the vibe alive forever\nIf I must go, die at 27\nThen at least I know I died a legend\nWill you roll and ride like we're together?\nAnd keep the vibe alive forever\nKeep the vibe alive forever\n\nI let these words seep through my soul\nAnd speak through the song\n'Cause if one day, I'm no longer here in the physical\nThen at least I give you my voice to listen to\nWhat is a beautiful life without a beautiful death?\nWhat is a beautiful mind, how is our beauty defined?\nIs it for you to decide, is it my duty to die?\nNo matter how I'm remembered, just let me be remembered\nKells\nYeah, forever young, though\nAlways be those crazy kids running wide-eyed down the boulevard\n27, Bloom", "youtube_link":
