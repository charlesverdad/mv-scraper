she had a point, didn't she?\n\nA bunch of stereotypes all in my head\nI remember doing the math like\n\"Yeah, I'm good at little league\"\n\nA preconceived idea of what it all meant\nFor those who liked the same sex, had the characteristics\nThe right-wing conservatives think it's a decision\n\nAnd you can be cured with some treatment and religion\nMan-made, rewiring of a predisposition\nPlaying God\n\nAh nah, here we go\n\"America the brave\" still fears what we don't know\nAnd \"God loves all His children\" is somehow forgotten\nBut we paraphrase a book written

gay\" gets dropped on the daily\nWe've become so numb to what we're saying\nOur culture founded from oppression\nYeah, we don't have acceptance for 'em\nCall each other faggots behind the keys of a message board\nA word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it\n\"Gay\" is synonymous with the lesser\nIt's the same hate that's caused wars from religion\nGender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment\nThe same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins\nIt's human rights for everybody, there is no difference\nLive on and be yourself\n\nWhen I was in church, they taught me something else\nIf you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed\nAnd that holy water that you soak in has been poisoned\nWhen everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless\nRather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen\n\nI might not be the same\nBut that's not important\nNo freedom 'til we're equal\nDamn right I support it\nI don't know\n\nMary Lambert:\nAnd I can't change\nEven if I tried\nEven if I wanted to\nAnd I can't change\nEven if I tried\nEven if I wanted to\nMy love, my love, my love\nShe keeps me warm\nShe keeps me warm\nShe keeps me warm\nShe keeps me warm\n\nMacklemore:\nWe press play\nDon't press pause\nProgress, march on\nWith a veil over our eyes\nWe turn our back on the cause\n'Til the day that my uncles can united by law\nKids are walkin' around the hallway\nPlagued by pain in their heart\nA world so hateful\nSomeone would rather die than be who they are\nAnd a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all\nBut it's a damn good place to start\nNo law's gonna change us\nWe have to change us\nWhatever god you believe in, we come from the same one\nStrip away the fear, underneath it's all the same
