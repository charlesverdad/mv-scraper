bigger\nPushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker\nBy eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor\nNever rich so we were out to make that steady figure\n\nOnce I was eleven years old my daddy told me\nGo get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely\nOnce I was eleven years old\n\nI always had that dream like my daddy before me\nSo I started writing songs, I started writing stories\nSomething about the glory, just always seemed to bore me\n'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me\n\nOnce I was 20 years old, my story got told\nBefore the morning sun, when life was lonely\nOnce I was 20 years old\n\nI only see my goals, I don't believe in failure\n'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major\nI got my boys with me at least those in favor\nAnd if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later\n\nOnce I was 20 years old, my story got told\nI was writing about everything, I saw before me\nOnce I was 20 years old\n\nSoon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold\nWe've traveled around the world and we're still rolling\nSoon we'll be 30 years old\n\nI'm still learning about life\nMy woman brought children for me\nSo I can sing them all my songs\nAnd I can tell them stories\nMost of my boys are with me\nSome are still out seeking glory\nAnd some I had to leave behind\nMy brother I'm still sorry\n\nSoon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61\nRemember life and then your life becomes a better one\nI made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once\nI hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month\n\nSoon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold\nOr will I have a lot of children who can warm me\nSoon I'll be 60 years old\nSoon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold\nOr will I have a lot of children who can warm me\nSoon I'll be 60 years old\n\nOnce I was seven years old, my momma told me\nGo make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely\nOnce I was seven

goodbye\nWherever we're standing\nI won't take you for granted\n'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time\n\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\n\nIn the blink of an eye\nJust a whisper of smoke\nYou could lose everything\nThe truth is you never know\n\nSo I'll kiss you longer baby\nAny chance that I get\nAnd I'll make the most of the minutes\nAnd love with no regrets\n\nSo let's take our time to say what we want\nHere's what we got before it's all gone\n'Cause no, we're not promised tomorrow\n\nSo I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you\nAnd I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye\nWherever we're standing\nI won't take you for granted\n'Cause we'll never know when, when we'll run out of time\n\nSo I'm gonna
