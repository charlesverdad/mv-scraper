her woes away\n'Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made\n\nBut there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark\nYou should know you're beautiful just the way you are\nAnd you don't have

your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful\n\nShe has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving\nYou know, covergirls eat nothing\nShe says \"beauty is pain and there's beauty in
