kunnen liggen aan die 5 Bacardi\nMaar ik denk dat het ligt aan je mooie face\nAan die mooie en o zo grote reet\nEn ik hoop dat je past op mn bagagedrager\nWant ik heb een nieuwe fiets, ik ben een ragemaker\nEn ik zet die track, skip die track\nDus spring maar op bij mij die fiets dan fietsen\nWe naar huis toe samen\n\nOnderweg vertelde ik wat je van mij wil horen\nJe zat aan de bar en wilde scoren\nBen gevallen voor je ogen en je sexy stijl\nJe lijkt de vrouwelijke Gerssie wel\nEn de volgende morgen was niet te geloven\nDie chick die was weg en had me voorgelogen\nEn ik had d'r nog wel zo lekker genomen\nMaar eindstand: ze had me fiets gestolen\n\nSpring maar achterop bij mij\nAchterop m'n fiets\nEn ik weet nog niet waar we naar toe gaan samen\nMaar dat boeit me ook helemaal

het zou kunnen liggen aan die vijftien whisky\nJe kleding is roze met blauw als fristi\nEn je heupen zijn sexy in die strakke skinny\nMisschien is het een idee om hier weg te gaan\nNaar een plek ergens hier ver vandaan\nNaar Parijs of naar Rome of naar Milaan\nOf als E.T. op een fiets helemaal naar de maan\n\nOnderweg vertel ik jou wat jet niet wil horen\nWant dat is wie ik door die jaren heen ben geworden\nNu ben ik oprecht en heb het beste voor je\nHet beste met je voor is soms slecht te verwoorden\nAls ik maar met je kan zijn de rest kan me niet schelen\nZij waren nep en ze wilden me breken\nEn jij past precies op m'n bagagedrager\nEn dat is dus wel gebleken\n\nSpring maar achterop bij mij\nAchterop m'n fiets\nEn ik weet nog niet waar we naartoe gaan samen\nMaar dat boeit me

junk geen money had gegeven\nDan kon je nu niet achterop (dan kon je nu niet achterop)\nUh zag je staan met je hoge hakken\nRooie lakken, zo sexy, zo'n klasse\nEnnuh ik werd verblind door je oorbellen\nSorry vergeet mezelf helemaal voor te stellen\nMijn naam is Sef, mag ik nu iets in je oor verstellen\nVind je sexy, geheimpje, niet doorvertellen\nNee ik pest je, meisje, begrijp je wel he\nIk heb een plekje vrij op mijn gazelle\nWe kunnen fietsen, flesje wijn bestellen\nOf dansen, ik weet niet, lijkt mij gezellig\nMaar beter zeg ik niets\nEn spring maar achterop\nDan krijg je van mij een lift\n\nSpring maar achterop bij mij\nAchterop m'n fiets\nEn ik weet nog niet waar we naartoe gaan samen\nMaar dat boeit me ook helemaal niets\nEn ik weet nog niet waar naartoe\nMaar dat maakt

afraid of the dark without you close to me\nI'm afraid of the dark without you close to me\n\nI went out to the forest and caught \nA hundred thousand fireflies\nAs they ricochet round the room \nThey remind me of your starry eyes\nSomeone else's might not have made me so sad \nBut this is the worst night I ever had\n\n'Cause I'm afraid of the dark without you close to me\nI'm afraid of the dark without you close to me\nAlways were\n\nYou won't be happy with me\nBut give me one more chance\nYou won't be happy anyway\n\nWhy do we still live here\nIn this repulsive town?\nAll our friends are in New York\n\nWhy do we keep shrieking\nWhen we mean soft things?\nWe should be whispering all the time", "youtube_link": "http://youtube.com/watch?v=Jf_l3EGQvL8", "views": 656701, "likes": 4571,

an accident, and were not just swimming through the sea\n\nWe cannot be a foundation that's built by chance\nI watched the floor unfold, feeling my sense of hope begin to follow\n\nThough the structure that we built is held together with paper walls\nI will let my lungs collapse before I let this fall\n\nI will let, I will let my lungs fail if we can't keep this room breathing\n'Cause I used to live inside a home that wouldn't fall down\nBut now we see what it means to be the wall when the bricks start to fall\n\nCalling out the details of your design\nBut it's all a waste when the blind are leading the blind\nThe blind are leading the blind\nEyes stapled shut\n\nThese arms are ripping at the seems, but I won't let this roof fall over me\nWe can't be moving in circles without a reason for us to live while were alive\n\nWho's your architect?\n\nI will let my lungs collapse before I ever let this\n\nFall, to any god above, to any heart you loved\nFall, to every oath you swore to me\n\nDaylight drapes your eyes, I am life and death\nI will give you purpose, and I'm the architect\n\nWe can't be moving in circles without a reason for us to live while were alive\nWho's your

hangin' around the house with all your friends\nSteady drinking smoking the green weed\nAnd head is sort of blinking\nYou're going with the flow\nAnd everybody is getting plowed\nThe voices and the music and the noise is getting loud\nYou got a heavy buzz on when seven o'clock rolls around\nSo you piule inside the clunker start heading downtown\nOnly nineteen but you know where you can get it\nSo you slide inside the bar and everything is hitting\nBy about eleven o'clock your brain is near dead\nYou really can't remember who was the one that said\nLet's go into the bathroom and meet this guy Chuck\nHe's got a thirty dollar white powder pick me up\nTen minutes later the whole vibe had changed\nYou try for conversation\nBut you know you're acting strange\nYour eyes are wide open but your smile is gone\nYou just keep fiending till the fucking break of dawn\n\nVipers slither atop a colder ground they quiver\nA crack in the sky snow is falling and inside we shiver\nWhile I doze
