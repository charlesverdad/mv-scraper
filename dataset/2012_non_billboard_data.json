rapture of the midnight sun\nShe's longing for immortal love\nNew moon hangs high, tell me will it ever end\n\nHere comes the bad rain\nFalling from an aching heart\nHere comes the bad rain\nDon't know when it's gonna stop\n\nShe's somewhere else\nShould be lying next to me\nUnder the spell\nTangled in her ecstasy\nFrom her vein she gave a streaming life\nLet him prey on her like a sacrifice\nStill she denies everything so brazenly\n\nHere comes the bad rain\nFalling from an aching heart\nHere comes the bad rain\nDon't know when it's gonna stop\n\nAnd in the madness of this love\nShe won't surrender 'til it's done\nAnd so I'm lost to wait\nGod this night could last forever\n\nAnd so it ends, kisses me and kills the lights\nThe living dead always leave her satisfied\n\nHere comes the bad rain\nFalling from an aching heart\nHere comes the bad rain\nDon't know when it's gonna stop\n\nHere comes the bad rain\n(Here comes the bad rain)\nFalling from an

Brenda doesn't even know\nJust 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow\nBut oh, that's a thought-my own revelation\nDo whatever it takes to resist the temptation\nBrenda got herself a boyfriend\nHer boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end\nShe tried to hide her pregnancy from her family\nWho didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she\nWent out, and had a church of kids\nAs long as when the check came they got first dibs\nNow Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger\nBut no one seems to notice any change in her figure\nShe's twelve years old, guess she's havin' a baby\nIn love with a molester who's sexin' her crazy\nAnd yet in all, she thinks that he'll be with her forever\nAnd dreams of a world where the two of 'em are together,\nWhatever, he left her, and she had the baby solo\nShe had it on the bathroom floor, and didn't know so\nShe didn't know what to throw away, and what to keep\nShe wrapped the baby up, and threw him in a trash heep\nI guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries\nShe didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes\nNow the baby's in the trash heep, ballin'\nMama can't help him, but it hurts to hear him callin'\nBrenda wants to run away, Mama say\nYou making me lose pay, a social worker's here everyday\nNow, Brenda's gotta make her own way\nCan't go to her family, they won't let her stay\nNo money, no babysitters, she couldn't keep a job\nShe tried to sell crack, but ended up gettin' robbed\nSo now what's next, there ain't nothin' left to sell\nSo she sees sex as her way of leavin' hell\nIt's

each morning after she lingered still longer\nAnd then hurried away at the sound of the bell\n\nThen came the morning when silence did greet me\nThe birds on the bushes were stricken and still\nSo I stepped on the path where she often did meet me\nAnd I walked to the factory up on the hill\n\nThe crowd gathered round, couldn't hide the destruction\nI cast my eyes on it in such disbelief\nA truth of the world settled into the ashes\nThe rich men's neglect is the poor man's grief\n\nAs I stood there a whisper it did caress me\nA faint scent of roses my senses begun\nI lifted my face and I saw
