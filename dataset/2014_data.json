humpin'\nThat ain't 'bout nothin' - if ever you mad about somethin'\nIt won't be that; oh no it won't be that\nI don't be at, places where we comfy at\nWith no be-atch; oh no you won't see that\nAnd no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin' this Earth's surface is\nBut girlfriend, work with the kid\nI keep you workin at Hermes, Burking Bag\nManolo Blahnik Timbs, aviator lens\n600 drops, Mercedes Benz\nThe only time you wear Burberry to swim\nAnd I don't have to worry, only worry is him\nShe do anything necessary for him\nAnd I do anything necessary for her\nSo don't let the necessary occur, yep\n\n(Jay) All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend\n(Bey) Down to ride till the very end, it's me and my boyfriend (me and my boyfriend)\n(Jay) All I need in this life of sin, is me

hurts you\nEven if that somebody was me (that somebody was me)\nYeah-hee (break it down for 'em B)\nSometimes I trip on how happy we could be\nAnd so I put this on my life\nNobody or nothing will ever come between us\nAnd I promise I'll give my life\nAnd all of my trust if you was my boyfriend\nPut this on my life\nThe air that I breathe in, all that I believe in\nI promise I'll give my life\nAnd
