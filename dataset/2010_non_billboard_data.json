love\nI'm just a stray boy in the shade\nAnd how I wish to know what love is like\nTo find someone to contemplate\n\nThere's a voice and a million answers\nTo the questions I don't ask\nA demon I've got to contain\nWhen I'm walking through the fen\nGetting deep into the black\nWhispers that I can't restrain\n\nDon't give in\n\nRise to fame - time will come\nMake your claim - time has come\nFor the crow to fly away\n\n(Jorn Lande)\nSo you're an angel meant to walk down here\nAnd you believe it's all divine\nAnd you don't play by all those temporal rules\nWatch the world begin to die\n\nAlright - when the lamb's been torn to pieces\nI've been crashing from the sky\nFallen to care for the prey\nThey put a spoke right in your wheel\nI'm the one to dare the weak\nTo push you all over the pain\n\nYou give in - oh\n\nRise to fame - time will come\nMake your claim - time has come\nFor the crow to fly away\n\n(Sammet)\nI close my eyes\nAnd I see what's coming my way - oh, yeah\nHe's got treasure in his eyes\nThat he's gonna turn to clay\n\n(Lande)\nHm, I'm a stranger, I'm a changer\nAnd I'm danger... maybe...\n\n(Sammet)\nFallen angel - waiting for the prey\nThe devil has come to take a maimed away\nPenetration of the twisted mind\nThe evil is out for the weak and blind \n\nI can feel it in your voice\nEver so sweet, no\nDo I really have a choice\nNo, no, no\n\n(Lande)\nOh, you burn your feet on unholy ground\nYou roam the barren, wicked plains abound\nIn evil eyes and evil speak\nAbout it all you evil freaks\n\nWhen you say it's all divine\nAnd meant to be, yeah\nWhat about your flesh and blood\nAnd defiers like me?\n\nTheir evil eyes are looking down on you\nAnd those who don't are losing sight of you\nFace the rage to chase away\nThe specter of disgrace and shame\n\nWithered roses dying on the ledge\nA withered dreamer standing on the edge\nYou dream of love, you wake up to pain\nYou're better off to join in my game\n\nThen she'll better off to cry\nContrite tears\nOne day she'll wonder why\nShe had to let you disappear, oh, dear\n\nRise to fame - your time has come\nTime will come - to take the sun\nMake your claim - you're drawn to the sound\nTime has come - you're leaving ground\n\nRise to fame - the flight of the crow\nTime will come - cross the line\nYour time has come - for the crow to fly away\nRise to fame - It's a flight to hell\nTime will come - Can you hear the bell\nRise to fame - The devil has come\nTime will come- To take your soul away\nA flight to hell, all right\n\nI'm a stranger\nI'm a changer\nAnd I'm danger\nFallen angel\nWaiting for the prey", "youtube_link": "http://youtube.com/watch?v=lPladYdbHao", "views": 90008, "likes": 641, "dislikes": 27, "updated": "2018-07-13 21:42:16.903740",
