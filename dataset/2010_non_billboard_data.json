radio stations nigga you know what happened.\n\nMe and Lloyd Banks ain't, (down, down)\nKeep talkin' shit, I'll lay you, (down, ooh well)\n\nYou niggas ran out the backdoor nigga,\nAll I wanted to do was holla man,\nTo see what was what.\n\nY'all was too fuckin' scared to come, (down, down)\nYou've been to Compton, you know how I get, (down, ooh well)\nSo fuck y'all nigga,\nAnd it's like

van der Hold\nI'm 68 years old\nI doubt some questions have increased\nIn 42 years of being a priest\nI'm at the end of my life\nI'm not sure if I'm gonna survive\nI often don't know what to say\nWhen I talk to Him, when I pray\nIn reply I receive\nOnly silence, no relief\nI've waited in vain for a little advice\nFrom that great voice in the ethereal skies\n\nOnce I was revolutionary\nA devoted mercenary\nA gifted student in God's hands\nNow I'm old and sick of his demands\nI tried to be honest and good\nDid my job the best I could\nBut I always stayed that average man\nRight in the spot where I'll began\nDuring the grief with which I've dealt\nSpent three decades since I've felt\nThe certainty I so have thought 'bout the existence of the Lord\n\nI've seen enough, that's why I know\nGod left this place, long long time ago\n\nI'll give him to my perish\nThings I don't have myself but cherish\nAnd namely love and charity\nMostly purpose that's what sets you free\nSo I'm where the metaphore\nI'm not comforting anymore\nI think I'm almost done with my search\nGot old so fast even in my church\nBut feels as if I'm kept out\nSome sort of secret about\nThe meaning of life sometimes\nCan't fail to notice these are mediocre types\n\nI've seen enough, that's why I know\nGod left this place, long long time ago\nI've seen enough, that's why I know\nGod left this place, long long time ago\n\nAnd time has made me good at one thing\nAnd horrible at everything else\nThe blessings of a world divine\nWere always elsewhere and never mine\nOh, I would like to hold someone\nBriefly maybe have some fun\nMy body's hardly designed\nSo I'm not really the hugging kind\nNot once has it been\nSomeone with a softer skin\nWho reached out for me in the middle of the night\n'Cause my own lumpy mattress would've turn on the light\nI think I've been miscast\nAnd the time of saints is passed\nMy faith is reclassed but not least\nAfter 42 years of being a priest\nThe church is like a woman\nThing out of reach like a vision\nShe glimmers in the distance which I could never quite get\nNow I've left you with my regret\n\nI've seen enough, that's why I know\nGod left this place, long long time ago\nI've seen enough, that's why I know\nGod left this place, long long time ago\n\nI've seen enough, that's why I know\nGod left this place, long long time ago\nI've seen

receive\nOnly silence, no relief\nI've waited in vain for a little advice\nFrom that great voice in the ethereal skies\n\nOnce I was revolutionary\nA devoted mercenary\nA gifted student in God's hands\nNow I'm old and sick of his demands\nI tried to be honest and good\nDid my job the best I could\nBut I always stayed that average man\nRight in the spot where I'll began\nDuring the grief with

hardly designed\nSo I'm not really the hugging kind\nNot once has it been\nSomeone with a softer skin\nWho reached out for me in the middle of the night\n'Cause my own lumpy mattress would've turn on the light\nI think I've been miscast\nAnd the time of saints is passed\nMy faith is reclassed but not least\nAfter 42 years of being a priest\nThe church is like a woman\nThing out of reach like a
