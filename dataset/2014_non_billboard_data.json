he go?\nWhere's Mr. Riddle and the Faraway Barns?\"\nI said, \"I'm sorry Mr. Harbut, I think they've all gone.\nThey moved all your bones to the outskirts of town\nAnd the farm is a housing development now\"\nHe sat right down with his hat in his hand\n\"Can you explain this, I can't understand\"\nI choked on the words\nI felt a great shame\n\nThey're selling the Bluegrass\nThe fences are black\nThe old days are gone\nAnd they ain't coming back\n\nI showed him the airport\nI showed him downtown\nThat Keeneland was using a loudspeaker now\nWe tried to see horses but couldn't find one\nWhen we drove Man O War Boulevard around Lexington\nThen he asked me to take him to the Horse Park to see\nWhere the bones of Man O War and Will Harbut lie buried\n\nIn '47 when Man O War died\nThe funeral was broadcast nationwide\nPresidents, Lords and grown women cried\nA casket lined with his colors, there were nine eulogies\nFor the greatest racehorse ever raised in Kentucky\n\nHe won 20 races in 21 starts\nOne loss to a horse called Upset caused by a bad start\nHe carried as much as 138 pounds\nNo horse alive would have to carry that now\nI first came to his gravesite when I was a child\nI remember white fences running for miles\nI watched the foals racing around just for fun\nAnd thought of the races the red stallion had won\n\nWe sat there in silence until the sunrise\nAs he started to fade he gave me a smile\nBring me three red roses to lay on my grave\nOne for my horses\nOne for my pride\nOne for a great way of life that has died\n\nNow you men who have sold out the Bluegrass for greed\nWith your Growth is Good stickers and your big companies\nMay you spend your life driving around and around\nThose cookie cutter houses you've made of this town\nMay you hear on your deathbed the Faraway bell\nAnd may the ghost of Will Harbut lead you to Hell", "youtube_link": "http://youtube.com/watch?v=9dITvuBbZqg", "views": 43532, "likes": 417, "dislikes": 6,

else comes last\n\nThere were times when you didn't know where I was at\n(So you'd call)\nI'd see your number on my cell knowing well I need to holla back\n(But I'd stall)\nAny other guy would leave if they were treated like that\nIt was no parade but you stayed, so this year it's a wrap\nIt's all about you this year\n\nI didn't mean to diss you babe\nIgnore or dismiss you babe\nHear me out and

Echo im raxenen Land!\" \nDoch die Trixie, die war schon erwaxen und sprach:\n\"Lieber Max, deine Faxen, die mach' ich nicht nach!\"\nHalli, halli, hallo!\n\nDa hopste der Max in die Schlucht und rief schnell:\n\"Halli!\"\nUnd das Echo erwiderte deutlich und hell:\n\"Hallo!\"\nDa rief Max voller Zorn, und sein Atem ging schwer:\n\"Hallo!\"\nUnd das Echo ert\u00f6nte genau wie vorher:\n\"Halli!\"\nUnd gixend hat Max es noch einmal versucht:\n\"Halli, halli, hallo!\"\nDoch das Echo' es gixte zur\u00fcck in die Schlucht:\n\"Hallo, hallo, halli!\" \n\nDa rief Max, und sein Herz schlug ihm bis an den Hals:\n\"Wie?\"\nDoch das Echo erwiderte nichts weiter als:\n\"Wo?\"\nUnd Max rief:\n\"Ja, Sie!\"\nUnd das Echo:\n\"Ja, so!\"\nUnd Max rief:\n\"No, wie?\"\nUnd das Echo:\n\"Niveau!\"\nUnd \"Hollodero\"\nWurde \"Hillideri\"\nUnd \"Ich geh' in den Zoo\"\nWar \"Och geh on den Zieh\"\nUnd er sank in die Kno -\nIch mein, in die Knie\nUnd wurde nicht froh\nBis um sechs in der Fr\u00fch\nDann rief er:\n\"Hallo!\"\nUnd das Echo:\n\"Halli!\"\nUnd er wusch H\u00e4nde und Gesocht -\nUnd ging auf's Kli\n\nUnd er dachte verzweifelt: \"Ich hab' mich blamiert\nMein Leben verpfuscht, Karriere ruiniert\nMein Automobil wird ein Autimibol\nJedes Liebesidyll ein Lobesodol\nErreich' ich die Spitzen\nSind nichts dort wie Spotzen\nUnd alle Matritzen\nWerden Matrotzen\nStatt Milch trink ich Molch\nStatt Bier krieg ich Bor\nMeine Kiefer werden Koffer\nUnd aus mir wird ein Mohr\nWill mich wer betr\u00fcgen\nBin ich schon betrogen\nUnd will ich was kriegen\nGeht's mir an den Krogen\nHalli, halli, hallo!\"\n\nUnd der Max schottelte seinen Kipf, und er sprach:\n\"Halli!\"\nJa, der Max schottelte seinen Kipf, und er sprach:\n\"Liebe Trixie, geh heim, denn ich kann dir nicht nach\nSag's meiner Frau und meinen drei Kondern!\nIch m\u00f6cht' ihnen selber die Schmerzen gern londern\nDoch w\u00fcrden sie mich weder lieben noch loben\nDrum bleib

F\u00fcxe, sie kamen und fanden den Max\nHalli!\nJetzt verjuxen die F\u00fcxe den Max auf der Rax\nUnd es quietschen die Knochen, es knaxet der Flax\nUnd ein jeder Fux leckt sich die Flanken und spricht:\n\"Dieser Max\nJa, ich sax\nIst ein Flaxengedicht!\nDie Flaxen, die Flaxen\nDie Muskulatur in den Haxen\nDie Axerln, die Waderln\nDie Schinkenrouladerln\nDie Schuacherln, die Sockerln\nDie
