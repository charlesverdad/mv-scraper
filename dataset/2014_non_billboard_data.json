for hell\nSuddenly I fell, rapidly\nThe heat of fire, smellin' brimstone\nThe demons and surrounding, molten lava\nGhouls and goblins, waiting for my soul to drop\nBut the moment I was espoused to hit the ground, is when I got up\nDamn, bad dream\n\nMaybe in another life, if we get another life\nMaybe in that life, I could love, to love you\nMaybe in another time, if there is another time\nMaybe in that time, I could learn, to love you.", "youtube_link": "http://youtube.com/watch?v=TMvtCD8DXKo", "views": 394916, "likes": 3002, "dislikes": 88, "updated": "2018-07-13 19:58:11.126525", "complete":
