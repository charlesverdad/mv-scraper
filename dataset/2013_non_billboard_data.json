calling\nAncient rage - reveals the lack of faith\nThe art of suffering - infernal pain, eternal twilight\nSeals the sense - now dethrone the king with the crown of thorns\nThe lord of emptiness - in covenant with the lord of hatred\n\nOn the eve of life - and the serpent rises from the lake of fire\nA violent holocaust - submit to death, submit to darkness\nVanquish faith - obliterate the human race\nOpen the halls of might\n\nBehold the dragon of light, the defender of life\nRaise the banner of the sun, unite the Templar's of the ancient realm\nAnd the knights of the crown adore the gods of the sun\n\nPitiless, invincible\n\nSolemn rites upon the altar\nSolemn rites on the glowing altar, enthrone the emperor\nBring the storm, the storm of sorrow\nThe storm of flames, salvation in fire - the art of suffering\nAncient rites, the words of power\nCarved in stone, unseals the tower - behold the altar of death\n\nPain strikes me down to the sour ground\nA mighty pain, deep down inside\nAnd my valour turns to fear\nBut my vocation remains\nI stare at the wasteland of the damned\nNot far away I rise again\nMust ignore the infernal pain\nMy vocation remains\n\nBow for the emperor - the superior, the dominator\nSubdue the world - conquer the sacred grounds\nA cold awakening - to the sound of drums the drums of power\nSteel meets steel - on the field of war where there's no more honor\n\nOpen the halls of might\nBehold the dragon of light, the defender of life\nRaise the banner of the sun, unite the Templar's of the ancient realm\nAnd the knights of the crown adore the gods
