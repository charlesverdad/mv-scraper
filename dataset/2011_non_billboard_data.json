Allah, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy\nI took your chick now you want beef\nAnd I'm just chuckling like a Porky\nBecause you spend all day with her spooning\nI spend all night with her forking\nThat's a one way ticket to hell\nAnd they want these bullets to book it for me\nMan, I'm shitting on every statistic that said I'll be dead or fucking broke\nThis is history\nYour kids, kids, kids, kids going to book
