from the bruising\nThey stood there above her all thinking the same thoughts at the same time\nThere's so much water, so close to home\n\nSo this is what they did,\nThey carried her downstream from their fishing\nBetween two rocks they gently wedged her\nAfter all they'd come so far, it was late\nAnd the girl would keep; she was going nowhere\nThey stayed up there fishing for two days\nThey reported it on Sunday when they came back down\nThere's so much water, so close to home\n\nWhen he holds me now I'm pretending\nNothing is working inside\nAnd behind my eyes, my daily disguise\nEverything's turning to white\n\nThe newspapers said that the girl had been strangled to death and also molested\nOn the day of the funeral the radio reported that a young man had been arrested\nI went to the service a stranger\nI drove past the lake out of town\nThere's so much water, so close to home\n\nWhen he holds me now I'm pretending\nI feel like I'm frozen inside\nAnd behind

been drinking scotch \nWhile touring through your town \n\nAdultry makes you give things away \nIt gets you confused \nAdultry takes a one room vacation \nThen it gets you alone \nTurns into a honeymoon scream \nThen you have to change the sheets \n\nSmoke in one hand looking for a light \nMartini in the other hand \nPointing out midnight \n\nNow that you pulled the school underwater \nAnd drowned the prom \nWhich man will you save for this Friday \nYou can put him in a fish pond \nAnd watch him swim around \nThen have a catholic dinner \n\nIf it isn't men it's death \nIt's the same old testament \nAt the cross her station keeping \nStood the mournful mother weeping \nWhere my man extended hung \nDriven with nails to wood \n\nSmoke in one hand looking for a drink \nDrink in the other hand \nPointing out midnight \n\nAt my desk as you're sleeping \nAs the big deal of death \nKills me and starts leaving \nEverybody asks me how I'm doing \nI'm doing everything alone \n\nRave on children and try to sleep \nLarks must sing grave, deep melodies \nHappy that they die \nThe sly brown fox pulled up a glass \nPulled up a chair \nAnd yanked out my hair \n\nWhen I tried to sit I fell down \nWhen I woke up he was gone \nSo one has a smoke one has a drink \nThe man is gone\nMary's dead \nGood morning midnight", "youtube_link": "http://youtube.com/watch?v=eb6H3c0mM5Y", "views":
