broncos\nThrough the congo, beneath the cosmos, Priest the 5th apostle\nI'm like Picasso, I paint a hot flow, the canvas is your mind\nWhen you visualize, you can see it like an art show\nIt's warm like a bullet goin' through the Pope shirt\nSinkin' in the lungs of the quiet Cardinal\nI'm like Leonardo Da Vinci, my pen squeeze out sculptures\nHigh, like a ski Alpen, grease with my feet stretched out\nOn a sheik sofa, turn that beat loud, I'm bout to freestyle, soldiers\nMy rhyme show the depths, like a rich photographer in Yugoslavia\nTo Romania, fills whole stadiums, to them Hungarians, that's done carryin'\nTo Bogaria, to the Bocan peninsula, the flow turn vocals into pictures\nThe beauty is like the snow fallin' in the winter\nRhymes, are like icons of heroin adicts\nWith fiends, with their bare arms, scratchin'\nThey palms practice, the plan that the white, can't craft to\nTurn our people backwards, in black hoods to Spanish Harlem\nThe plan is Gotham, and I'm Batman, amongst these crack lands\nI hold revolvers, listen to the soul of Marvin\nTo bring back the promise, it's Black Market\n\n(Interlude: William Cooper)\nChill, Priest, yo chill\n'Cause you got William Cooper in here\nYou know this Black Market, you got Tragedy Khadafi\nYou got Razah the Renaissance --\n\n(William Cooper)\nStroll through the tunnels of death, fighting the devil\nEvery night go to battle, squeeze that nine milli' metal\nUntil that beat settles, plus randomly complete me\n'Cause they all beneath me, when night falls, we speak in tepee's\nMy peace pipes are Philly, demons grill me\nIt takes a proverb and a chronic herb to thrill me\nI keep pennin' for a moment, second amendment, I own it\nJust give me a minute, I'm zonin', like Pagan prisons, I'm thronin'\nSay my name, vision a Roman, the Trojan spittin' on omens\nWhy shogun never have a slow gun, trust no one\nBut Market fam, you know it's on, when the flag market's land\nStick it in the soil, we only toast with the loyal\n\n(Interlude: Hell Razah)\nDrink up, breadren, get off the grounds, break bread\nUh-huh, yeah, take this jewel\n\n(Hell Razah)\nIn the hood, guns go off, advise you, to don't show off\nYou can die in the streets, or the seat of your Porsche\nI seen drama back off, when you handle the boss\nBurn a cross on the White House porch, with no remorse\nFour horses of apocalypse, hidin' politics\nCommon sense, where the poor's oppress, a prophet is\nHe maybe live in a project crib, the more hard livin' it is\nMothers be abortionin' kids, birth control\nThe few will make it, most of them fold\nI'mma break it when it's cold, or a tissue to a runny nose\nAnd when we die, is the answer that God knows\nTill then, tell the angel of death, he's no threat\nJesus wept, when Lazarus left, he got vexed\nHe symbolic to that parable, follow the footsteps\nAin't no tellin' what felon could die in the hood next\n\n(Interlude: Killah Priest)\nYeah baby, Black Market, lift ya
