front row\nInto psychos on pogo sticks at gun shows\nNot a stunt show, half booty naked like Squanto\nBut with bobo dreads draped on my burgundy poncho\nIt sort of makes an ordinary ninja like me\nLook like an Oakland Raider runningback tackling geeks\nBaby I'm hectic from the helmet to the spikes on my feet\nIf interested man I'll bless it with a mic and a beat\nRedCloud is hyper on speed, the crowd will like it indeed\nYou'll jump around like Everlast did in the stifling heat\nIf you're impressed with the direction that I rock and compete\nThen chuck your fists up in the sky because the job is complete\n\n8000 RPMs is redline\nYour Chevy and your Ford V8s can't touch mine\n4 banging and hanging with 10 second time\nBring it in the form of a rhyme\nIt's redline\n\nWe're the Boondock Saints, Jake it ain't no joke\n'Cause it's cool and calm, come in a room full of smoke\nLike a broken tapedeck in an ancient basement\nAnd the blaze is raging but the barricade's broke\nI never serenaded every lady I approach\nI'm just soaking up the mocha, sipping cocoa to the throat\nCappuccino IV is mighty kind yo when it's cold\nFeeling older than Hoboken hobos covered in a cloak\nI'm smothering the southern bay\nMother to other ways\nBlasting rays like an ambassador from outer space\nHovering to cover days\nBrother of the ricochet\nCrenshaw chainsaw massacre, I'm leatherface\nLater days, feather-ended pen, sever wicked ways\nKick it like a cricket's legs chirping in a little cage\nTicketMaster tickets, time is ticking till I hit the stage\nWiggling the middle, giving praises through the nickel plate\n\nThis one goes out to L ScatterBrain\nAnd DJ Mino 92 and the gang\nOriginal redlining, shining bright in fact\nMy brethren SP, all the numerous cats\nRoto Rooter, my motor scooter is parked outside of Hooters\nIf my lady finds out there is no doubt I'm getting neutered\nIt suits me well and super, my crew's like superhumans\nConfused with Mighty Morphin's, the truth we are VR Troopers\nI might cold cock these country sucker chumps with an uppercut\nAnd roughing up these diamond-studded busters till they pucker up\nI'm tough enough to run you over with a pick-up truck\nAnd scrape you off the pavement with a shovel, brother listen up\nThis is for the Clan, for the Tribe, for the Crew\nThis is for the Clique, for the Mob, for the Youth\nThis

lost and found in it berserk\nI've been burned by the fire, scorched by the flame\nOf my own sins and desires so I call them by their names\nWhen they come, greed, gluttony, sloth, envy, and lust\nThey're all enemies but they act so friendly with us\n\nThey roll with two other guys we call wrath and pride\nNow I'm half as high as I am low\nI can laugh and cry at the same time but I can't slow\nDown feeling manicy, panicky, full of anarchy\nCan it be so simple to get rid of them with Ritalin?\nI'm trying to get into Heaven cutting out the middleman\n\nEvery time I drift away I see myself dead and buried in the cemetery\nAccidentally staring at the sun\nShining through the filthy glass windows\nBroken bottles in the bedsheets dangle bloody naked with a gun\nI'm living in this tiny-ass room with the mattress on the floor\n\nAnd an ashtray, look what I've become\nLight up a half-sniped cigarette take my last swig of liquor\nSmoke the filter down down till it's done\nBut I ain't done\nI'm cold-blooded, stuck with the spirit of Hell frozen\n\nHere's a hole inside my soul, my fear and my self-loathing\nGot me hallucinating that all my walls are closing in (closing in)\nI think I'm losing my grip, there it goes again\nThese demons live inside of me, they talk to me and lie to me\nWhisper homicidally, I'm trying to get them out of me\n\nBut I can see the side of me, it's just becoming clearer\nI'm starting to hate the sight of me, I break the fucking mirror\nPlease Jesus just just just listen to my prayer if you can please\nI'm believing that these distances I've gone too far to leave\nI'm breathing in the sickness this addiction and disease\n\nThis mess I'm in, this vicious is my missus and my mistresses\nI'm twisted and ballistic, I'm addicted to this world\nForgive me for the pain that I've inflicted on my girl\nAnd my son, I was stuck holding his bottle and a gun\nAnd I couldn't get away where I was from\n\nEvery time I drift away I see myself

school, know school rules\nAll these years I been voicin' my blues\nI'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart\nGraffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent\nBut Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with\nBooks to read, like X and stuff\n'Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia\nIn art class I was a compulsive sketcher of\nTeachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up\n'Cause none'a them would like my style\nRead more books than the curriculum profile\nSaid, \"Mr. Jones please come get your child\n'Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild\"\n(Olu Dara singing)\nGreatest man - The great-greatest man alive\n\n(Verse 3: Nas)\nHey-Hey-Hey -- My Poppa was not a Rollin' Stone\nHe been around the world blowin' his horn, still

Africa is where we lived\nBetter known as Queenbridge\n(Nas)\nNas, Nas you don't stop\nOlu Dara in the house, you don't stop\nMuddy Waters' Howling Wolf you don't stop\nFrom the Blues to Street Hop

Aye Dub! Aye Dre! Aye Irv! you know it's all year right? Hah! I'm sitting here in the middle of New York City, the night before I gotta turn my second album in, higher than a motherfucker, drunker than a motherfucker, with my boys, and I'm thinking, damn, man 5 years ago, we were dead broke chilling in Cleveland everyday, and the next thing you know, people are calling us about record deals. And you know, the crazy part is, Ashleigh rented this white Nissan Altima for me and Slim so we could drive out to New York. I think she had to some work some shit or something, so she couldn't go so we were gonna go out there and see what these labels were talking about. And I'm driving us there, but my license's suspended so I tell Slim, I'm like \"Yo, I gotta pull up before we get to New York and switch, so you can drive in case we get pulled over\" 'cause we got pulled over the last time we went there. But you know, he had a license so it made sense for him to drive so cut to like 7 and a half hours later, I'm pulling over in this emergency lane and right as I'm opening the door to switch with Slim, boom! This fucking car going full speed on the highway swerves off the road and smashed into us. Yo, I swear to God I woke up half my body's laying outside the car in the ditch, like 15-20 feet away from where we just were. The car was totalled, the windows were smashed, it was cold as fuck, it was raining outside, but we were actually okay. I mean, my boy had to go the hospital you know the ambulance came and shit, he ended up being alright, but our meeting's with the record label started at 2 and we didn't have no car, and now we were stuck in a fucking hospital in New Jersey. So this dude that, I ended up partnering with later on, his name's James McMillan, he comes and gets us to these meetings and shit, somehow, someway. I don't know if it was just because we just got into a crazy car crash and could've died a couple of hours ago but I'm in there and like you know I'm not feeling this shit man I'm not feeling this record label shit and we drove back to Cleveland. Now I'm back in Ashleigh's mom's basement, I'm thinking about life, you know, I'm on a shit ton of vicodin 'cause the doctors at the hospital you know gave us something 'cause we got into that car accident and Ashleigh runs downstairs and she's like \"Yo, yo, Kells, Kells, you're not gonna believe who wants to talk to you right now.\" I'm like, \"who?\" She's like \"He's gonna call you in 30 seconds.\" Now I guess, when I was in New York, I had made some kinda noise 'cause this dude named Byron who ended up becoming my manager later on took this video I had called \"Chip off the Block\" over to Bad Boy and showed Harve Pierre and Harve Pierre went and showed that vid to a guy named Puff, so I answer my phone, depressed, down, fucked up on vicodin and I hear: \"Please hold, I have Mister Sean Combs for you.\" I said, god damn, life's about to change, man, I felt it. And sometimes that's all it takes, it's just that feeling you know what I mean. I knew I was gonna be here, and now I'm here\n\nFeel that, uh\nLace up, Kells\nLace up, Kells\nFarewell, yeah\nThis that shit you bob your head to\nThis that brand new instrumental\nI heard he puts his city on\nThat boy, Kells", "youtube_link": "http://youtube.com/watch?v=dVRNGPQc_s4", "views": 6704794, "likes": 78570, "dislikes": 2705, "updated": "2018-07-13 22:01:51.755654", "complete": true}]
