who she's bringing.\nIt's you, only it's bigger and thinner and wider.\n\nI touch the leaves of the plant next to me.\nThey're thicker than they were the last time I touched them\nAnd it curls quickly around my hand\nThere are stars up there even when you can't see them\nI'll tell you something that really bothers me.\nHow are we supposed to get anything done\nWith those stars casting shadows that look just like spiders?\nYeah, it's you, but this time you're coiled up much tighter.", "youtube_link": "http://youtube.com/watch?v=K_W1p2XE6ug", "views": 4784, "likes": 105, "dislikes": 13,

take my money and run Venezuela\n\nWell the money was to buy my house and land\nThen she got a serious plan\nMatilda she take my money and run Venezuela\n\nWell the money was just inside my bed\nStuck up in the pillow beneath my head\nMatilda she take my money and run Venezuela\n\nWell my friends never to love again\nAll my money gone in vain\nMatilda she take my money and run Venezuela",
