buzzards circle around his head\nWaiting for him to drop dead, was it\nOr was it 'cause them bitches wrote him off\nLittle hussy ass, 'cause fuck, guess it doesn't matter now, does it\n\nWhat difference it make, what's it take, to get it through your thick skulls\nIf this ain't, some bullshit people don't usually come back this way\nFrom a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place\nNow let these words be like a switch blade to a hater's rib cage\n\nAnd let it be known from this day forward\nI wanna just say thanks 'cause your hate is what gave me the strength\nSo let

that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic\nTell him how real he is or how high I am\nOr how I would kill for him to know it\n\nI cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back\nSo it's only right that I

missing you\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time\n\nI miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile\nSo good to me, so right\nAnd how you held me in your arms that September night\nThe first time you ever saw me cry\nMaybe this is wishful thinking\nProbably mindless dreaming\nBut if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right\nI'd go back in time and change it, but I can't\nSo if the chain is on your door, I understand\n\nBut this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night\nAnd I go back to December...\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI'd go back to December, turn around and
