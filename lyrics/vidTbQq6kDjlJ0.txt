will you die for your country will you bleed for your team leave home and live by strangers surrender all your dreams  will you live by the sword will you die by the gun will you always leave forever like ten thousand shining suns  keep on searching for sparks repeat  will you never have to question what is right and what is wrong waiting for your glory call hope its not too long  so speak so merrily gently let nothing be disturbed walk sideways as you pass on by and nothing will occur  keep on searching for sparks repeat  the monna lisas missing the king has lost his head nothing ever changes everythings the same everythings the same everythings the same  keep on searching for sparks repeat to fade
