i was standin by my window yesterday morning without a thought of sorrow or of care when i saw the postman comin up the pathway with such a smiling face and jolly air  he rang the bell and whistled as he waited then he said good morning to you jack but he little knew the sorrow that he brought me when he handed me a letter edged in black  with trembling hands i took the letter from him i open it and sifted what it said come home my boy your dear old daddy wants you come home my boy your dear old mothers dead   instrumental   the last words your mother ever uttered tell my boy i want him to come back my eyes are blurred my poor old heart is breaking as i write to you this letter edged in black  those angry words i wish id never spoken you know i didnt mean them dont you jack may the angels bear me witness i am asking your forgiveness in this letter edged in black
