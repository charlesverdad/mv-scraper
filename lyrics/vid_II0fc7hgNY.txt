just seen empty future and i still believing in it her tears could be sweet i dont need tears of honey  i know god is so cruel just cant stop plaing the song i feel you breathe so close you play the note the rising sun is taking my eyes  new silver morning cold brick walls i dip both arms in the sky you dived to fry or to fall dont know one thing i know feel your tears on my palm your tears tears of honey
