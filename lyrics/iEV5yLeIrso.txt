maybe im just a loser whose will is none too strong but i dont want to lose her even if my choice is wrong ive been used to all the heartache the jealousy and pain so im well aware of what it takes to win her back again  i played a fool for her smile i found a groove in her style i hung on every word that she said but she was living up inside my head and i better think this whole thing through for awhile  im not one to gamble but in love my rules slide when my heart starts to ramble  i just hang on for the ride ive sought advice from all of my friends ive even read a million books but all those good intentions and when she gives me that comeon look  i played a fool for her smile i found a groove in her style i hung on every word that she said but she was living up inside my head and i better think this whole thing through for awhile  i could go on in misery but this feeling just wont die shes healing on delivery i have to give her one more try its really time to figure out if this love we have is real and lets find out what its all about and give the old cards one more deal  i played a fool for her smile i found a groove in her style i hung on every word that she said but she was living up inside my head and i better think this whole thing through for awhile
