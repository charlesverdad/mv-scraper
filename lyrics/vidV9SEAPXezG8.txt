guess we came up in a ghost town now all those buildings have burned down another price to be paid for being free  its getting harder to see now that the lights have all gone out cant pay for the electricity  and all along theyve been saying nothing new to me lately seems right is wrong and wrong is everything we need maybe and still the beds are burning burning in our sleep take me away from everything i see  there gunshots on the dancefloor please tell me what do we die for and by the way yesterday bet you were me  seen hard days probably see more theres police at the front door saying by the way yesterday heard you were free  and all along theyve been saying nothing new to me lately seems right is wrong and wrong is everything we need maybe and still the beds are burning burning in our sleep take me away from everything i see  and well dance on the ashes of whats left as long as these hearts beat in our chests and we fell through the railings and pavements while i wondered if they get what i get and i promise you i wont be leaving without taking you where i go see the price of beliefs in believing anywhere that we go well be share this same old song  and well be standing singing as if its life were living as if its blood were spilling as if were leaving here someday
