you swine you were supposed to look after her she needs you more than ever you took the easy way out even though it was hard for you im blaming you if it happens to her too ive heard that you were inside of all this pain you passed it over to someone so it can kill again  but im sure you had a damn good reason you should have at least filled in the blanks watching the nightsky now shes all alone looking for the star that is your new home  no way out of the inside you trapped her there never to be the same again she just inherited your pain  i have faith that she wont blame herself i guess you loved her i know that she loved you do you think shell ever find someone new  but im sure you had a damn good reason you should have at least filled in the blanks watching the nightsky now shes all alone looking for the star that is your new home  i never knew you im not sure i wanted to i never knew you im not sure i wanted to  and i hope that you had a damn good reason you should have at least filled in the blanks you left her here that night shes on her own trying to console her but she feels alone  but im sure you had a damn good reason you should have at least filled in the blanks watching the nightsky now shes all alone looking for the star that is your new home
