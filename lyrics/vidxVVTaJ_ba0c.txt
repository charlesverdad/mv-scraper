he was a child i was a child sentimental and wild now were resting now were resting for twelve short years we lived out of health and of prosperous wealth oh my dearest oh my dearest my only portrait to remind you my wine on your old cloak my voice sustained in our piano comme les carillons de notre nuit de noces heir of my illness writer of all the stories and the words that im haunting that im haunting when your heart is on your sleeve then ill bid you my sweet adieu dont forget me dont forget me the other woman to explain her letters i deplore im the flare inside your sorry dark eyes and ill leave you nevermore
