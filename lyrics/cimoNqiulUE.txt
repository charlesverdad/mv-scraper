so long ago i dont remember when thats when he said you must be born again but since he died jesus hasnt spoken much to me my visit to this cemeterys bleak he said the sons comin back when the funeral is done ive long hoped hed somehow pull it off the stone its been rolled away and all we haves an empty grave i wonder if he hung around this place  come on try to listen  you can get forgiven this gospel means something better than just religion but we have seen the savior  put it all the papers we can drive it home with one headline  she said he told me to get his friends and say the man they put faith in has been raised so theres got to be a hope that he could somehow he even pardon me through his amazing holiness and grace i see the son up ahead as those doubts of mine fade says all is good theres nothing left to dread i run and tell the other friends the man they killed is not still dead but in the end theres just three words i said heyeyey  come on try to listen  you can get forgiven this gospel means something better than just religion but me ive seen the savior  put it all the papers we can drive it home with one headline  my faith is bold still they might just beat us up they heard the message but the lesson wasnt learned we tell them jesus christ is resurrected they just all act circumspect sometimes i think theyd like to watch us burn ive seen it all and hes just like nobody else man ive been changed and ill never be the same and some will hear instantly but in this dramas final scene i think the skeptics might be killing me  come on try to listen  you can get forgiven this gospel means something better than just religion but we have seen the savior  put it all the papers we can drive it home with one headline
