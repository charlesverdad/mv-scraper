so cold and lonely it seems so long since someone was here following the shadows with the sun till it disappears thousands of stone white crosses a formation for all to see with flags and flames the ranks and the names of those who died to be free  the fire remains in our hearts all of our dreams made new etched in the flames of freedom were living on through you  were the shadow soldiers laid to rest standing tall shadow soldiers in freedom you live thats why weve given it all  taken too soon from the lives we loved a misery i can not explain only when we feel your presence are we sure we did not die in vein the fire remains in our hearts all of our dreams made new etched in the flames of freedom are these words oh so true were living on through you  were the shadow soldiers laid to rest standing tall shadow soldiers in freedom you live thats why weve given it all   the fire remains in our hearts all of our dreams made new etched in the flames of freedom were living on through you  were the shadow soldiers laid to rest standing tall shadow soldiers in freedom you live thats why weve given it all shallow soldiers laid to rest standing tall shadow soldiers in freedom you live thats why weve given it all
