sometimes when i am lonely i get to thinking bout the places that ive been i turn around in the same old direction once again im going home on a midnight train  when i left you was the middle of the winter the ground was covered by a cold cold snow my heart was young and i was searching but in vain im going home on a midnight train  home is not just a place where you are living home means more when youve got no place to go and when youre down and need someone to stand beside you turn around and go on home  when youre down and need someone to stand beside you turn around and go on home
