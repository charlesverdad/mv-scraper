as i walk this land of broken dreams i have visions of many things but happiness is just an illusion filled with sadness and confusion  what becomes of the brokenhearted who had love thats now departed i know ive got to find some kind of peace of mind  maybe the fruits of love grow all around but for me they come a tumblin down everyday heartaches grow a little stronger i cant stand this pain much longer  i walk in shadows searching for light cold and alone no comfort in sight hoping and prayin for someone to care always movin and goin nowhere  what becomes of the brokenhearted who had love thats now departed i know ive got to find some kind of peace of mind help me please  im searching though i dont succeed for someones love theres a growing need all is lost theres no place for beginning all thats left is an unhappy ending  now what becomes of the brokenhearted who had love thats now departed i know ive got to find some kind of peace of mind ill be searching everywhere just to find someone to care  ill be looking everyday i know ive got to find a way nothings gonna stop me now ill find a way somehow ill be searching everywhere
