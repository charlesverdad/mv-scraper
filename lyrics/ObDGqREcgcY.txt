i met the demon on a summers day her name was lily anne was what she said she was standing there alone waiting for the fall  so i asked her would she wait with me for night to take this day away but with the night she ran away the demon clad in grey  i summon the demon you  so i learned the ways the demon plays from this beauty clad in ashen grey how she left me with the fall left me all alone  only sorcerers of death remains only shadowed ones as some would see and the night that sings to me of lily anne the grey  i summon the demon you lily anne
