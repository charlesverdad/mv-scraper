you cut me down into little pieces before i could stand up so i built a wall out of all my secrets and now its opened up and i remember the cold cold mornings and i remember the rainy afternoons when i was dreaming that i was 22 that i was 22 i wish i was older when i was young but half the worlds asleep till the morning came and took me away now im longing i wish that i had found out faster i never thought its me theyre after when i was dreaming that i was 22 when i was 22 oh la da da da ooh and i remember the cold cold mornings i never thought it was me theyre wanting when i was dreaming oh la da da when i was dreaming oh when i was dreaming that i was 22 that i was 22
