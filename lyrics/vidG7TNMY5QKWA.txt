written by marv ross its just too easy to hide in these trees rust in this water up to your knees not many dreamers ever get out alive some kind of sickness sleeps in this town i barely got out but so many drown the more you struggle  the faster youre gonna sink youre shakin youre shakin the jinx youre beating the odds by the skin of your teeth baby baby its a long way down they want to be there when you hit the ground you gotta shake it right in their face and smile and when youve got em right in the palm of your hand you dont need em cause you understand so you turn slowly and you give the boys one last wink and then youre shakin youre shakin the jinx youre beating the odds by the skin of your teeth  you gotta face the fools who put sand in the gears you gotta shake a fist at a thousand different fears you gotta break it fake it but never let em know what you think while youre shakin youre shakin the jinx youre beating the odds by the skin of your teeth
