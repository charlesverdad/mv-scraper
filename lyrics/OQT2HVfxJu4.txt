you clean me up you take me down and what you want is what i love the colors of the world that lead me home tonight one two too many times you tend to trick me up now that i know its all you want its still never enough  calling on the backlines crawling from the battle to the other side if courage is a lot lighter i see it in your eyes  too many plays and they know how to keep a choke on you but youve got powerpressure when i have too much to lose the stakes are high my mind is twisted and the pressures off at 4 oclock we went ahead more dizzy than a flood  calling on the backlines crawling for the battle to the other side the courage a lot lighter i see it in your eyes running from the battle to the other side if freedom isnt hardwired i see it in your eyes  calling on the backlines crawling from the battle to the other side if living isnt hard wired i see it in your eyes crawling from the backlines hiding from the shadows that we left behind courage is a lot wider i see it in your eyes see it in your eyes i see it in your eyes
