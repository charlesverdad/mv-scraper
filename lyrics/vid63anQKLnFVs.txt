in my life theres no truth theres just mountains of lies search for identity but wear a disguise i run and i run and i run and i run and i hide im complicated so frustrating i know you hate it but i just cant fake it youve seen my worlds at war when i unlock my door showed you things i hoped you never see you just said oh george you could be so much more youve lost your way its a damn shame  how do you criticize when you stand so safe inside how do you climb when you built your walls so high how do you fight when your hands are firmly tied how do you rise when all you know is the downside
