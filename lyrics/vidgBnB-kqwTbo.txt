life is still spinning your end my beginning and everything i hoped for has been strangely set aside no reason for living my mind is forgiving and destiny is proving to be absent from my life  i know it i feel it  i know when youre sleeping i know the things youre dreaming  and i know you will never give up and die  conscious fulfilling the darkness revealing all thoughts and insecurities are shining like the sun eyes are deceiving your mind will stop breathing and all that you are made of will now rightly become mine  you know it you feel it  i know when youre sleeping i know the things youre dreaming i love it when youre weeping even death cant stop this feeling  and i know you will never give up and die  father why have you forsaken me my life is gone father you know how long its taken me i live again  i know when youre sleeping i know the things youre dreaming  i know when youre sleeping i know the things youre dreaming i love when youre weeping even death cant stop this feeling  i know when youre sleeping i know the things youre dreaming i love when youre weeping even death cant stop this feeling  and i know you will never give up no you will never give up you will never give up and die
