wait cant you stay before the hands of the world will try to take you away i cant forget dark scarlet nights couse when nobody sees you its hard to believe youre alive  were like satellites falling like satellites  maybe a long night drive will help me forget my friend another dream of you last thing that i could stand i never had enough courage to say these words this may be my last time to let it go  dont open your eyes you didnt sleep long enough and the world didnt change through the night another shot with no regrets cause thats all you know and no one can take it away
