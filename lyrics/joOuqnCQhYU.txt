the blade of my knife faced away from your heart those last few nights it turned and sliced you apart this love that i tell now feels lonely as hell from this padded prison cell  so many times i said youd only be mine i gave my blood and my tears and loved you cyanide when you took my lips i took your breath sometimes loves better off dead  youre all i need make you only mine i loved you so i set you free i had to take your life youre all i need youre all i need and i loved you but you didnt love me laid out cold now were both alone but killing you helped me keep you home i guess it was bad cause love can be sad but we finally made the news  tied up smiling i thought you were happy never opened your eyes i thought you were napping i got so much to learn about love in this world but we finally made the news  youre all i need make you only mine
