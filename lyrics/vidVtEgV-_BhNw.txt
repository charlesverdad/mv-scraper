laying down the law  listen to the hammer mouth of madness  watch the wicked gather streets of stone  underneath gray skies nights come  they speak of devils in disguise  it takes people like you to make people like me it takes people like me to make people like you  lets start a riot another night in london lets start a riot while the night is still young repeat while the night is still young  shadows of light  not a glimpse of the sun going till morning  till the battles won streets of stone  underneath gray skies nights come  they speak of devils in disguise  prechorus  chorus  shots fired  the sound of a new generation no future  no revolution  for you x2 for me no fucking revolution  for you  prechorus  chorus shots fired fights while the night is still young
