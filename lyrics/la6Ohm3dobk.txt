been a long time in a low place surrounded by what i have made need to get away get away from what relates and what was done  cause its all over now  through the woods i come running to lose leaf and carve my name in the lines theres not a trace i hear the ghost whisper and those old eyes watching me but i feel safe  grandfather looking over me  he said dont make them wait gotta go a long way lets be brave dont make them wait nah dont make them wait  i sat down with a coffee on my bent knee looking out at the burnt land looking back at me these used to be green crops and high on a summer breeze no its fallow fields and clearcut barren weeds  they said that if i stared the abyss would stare back at me so i did and i felt it slowly creep in me save for the smoke that danced when i took a drag it made me think about the way it all came to be  grandmama watching over me  and she said dont make them wait gotta go a long way lets be brave dont make them wait nah dont make them wait  dont make them wait nah dont make them wait  i hear the ghost whisper and those old eyes watching me but i feel safe i feel safe
