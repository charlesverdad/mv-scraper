it was on a hot day that johnny lost his mind he drove his pickup to his shack and soon hit the moonshine he laughed and he cheered until the hour got late and when the moon came up he pulled out his thirty eight  he danced just like fire he fell down just like rain but all flames must expire while the ashes still remain  nobody knows exactly what went wrong the night that johnny took a blade and cut of his tongue and then gave to the dogs just to watch them fight not a word he would speak since that bleak night  he danced just like fire he fell down just like rain but all flames must expire while the ashes still remain  well he sat up all night reading his bible and the next morning drove a nail through his eyeball then he went outside and started digging a hole deep down in the soil looking for his lost soul  he danced just like fire he fell down just like rain but all flames must expire while the ashes still remain
