in the morning when i wake and the sun is coming through oh you fill my lungs with sweetness and you fill my head with you  shall i write it in a letter shall i try to get it down oh you fill my head with pieces of a song i cant get out  can i be close to you oohoohoohooh ooh can i be close to you ooh ooh  can i take it to a morning where the fields are painted gold and the trees are filled with memories of the feelings never told  when the evening pulls the sun down and the day is almost through oh the whole world it is sleeping but my world is you  can i be close to you ah ooh ah ooh ah can i be close to you ah ooh ah ooh ah  can i be close to you ah ooh ah ooh ah can i be close to you ah ooh ah ooh ah  can i be close to you ooh ooh
