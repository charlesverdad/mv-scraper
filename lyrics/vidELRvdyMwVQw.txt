lyrics danne  a shade of death appears at the horizon with a cold embrace arrive the angels of darkness from a rip in the sky the portal of madness a furious dawn the dawn of destruction  a violent holocaust  inevitable fate is calling ancient rage  reveals the lack of faith the art of suffering  infernal pain eternal twilight seals the sense  now dethrone the king with the crown of thorns the lord of emptiness  in covenant with the lord of hatred  on the eve of life  and the serpent rises from the lake of fire a violent holocaust  submit to death submit to darkness vanquish faith  obliterate the human race open the halls of might  behold the dragon of light the defender of life raise the banner of the sun unite the templars of the ancient realm and the knights of the crown adore the gods of the sun  pitiless invincible  solemn rites upon the altar solemn rites on the glowing altar enthrone the emperor bring the storm the storm of sorrow the storm of flames salvation in fire  the art of suffering ancient rites the words of power carved in stone unseals the tower  behold the altar of death  pain strikes me down to the sour ground a mighty pain deep down inside and my valour turns to fear but my vocation remains i stare at the wasteland of the damned not far away i rise again must ignore the infernal pain my vocation remains  bow for the emperor  the superior the dominator subdue the world  conquer the sacred grounds a cold awakening  to the sound of drums the drums of power steel meets steel  on the field of war where theres no more honor  open the halls of might behold the dragon of light the defender of life raise the banner of the sun unite the templars of the ancient realm and the knights of the crown adore the gods of the sun find the river of blood seek enlightenment in the world beyond seal the source of the damned the curse of the land  pitiless invincible
