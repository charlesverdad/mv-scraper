ive got fucking teeth for eyes i am the smell of concentration bite and chew and never swallow never close the fist i will only crawl or sprint i will only starve or glut i will only love or kill im too big for that cross  dont make me say it i cant even watch all hell broke loose haunted  telling lies is getting old but the truth has lost its purpose inside the torn apart a spiraling selfhate you will only stand and stare you will only cut and run i am only eyes and mouth you only feed my appetite  dont make me say it i cant even watch all hell broke loose haunted
