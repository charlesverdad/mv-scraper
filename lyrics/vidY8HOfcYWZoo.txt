lord it hurts living in the world  where its so easy to be torn apart  ive learned to hide the feelings deep inside  but what im telling you is from my heart  its your love that opens up eternity  to a heart nothing else could reach  and if all i know is love and i leave the rest behind  that will be enough to take me to the sky   i am strong only when im holding on  to the greatest truth ive ever known  for when i lose myself in you  you take me farther than ive gone alone  its your love that opens up eternity  to a heart nothing else could reach  and if all i know is love and i leave the rest behind  that will be enough to take me to the sky   it is love that led your son to calvary  and it is love that opened up my eyes to see  that it is love that held him to the cross  and it will be enough if all i have is love   and if all i know is love and i leave the rest behind  that will be enough if all i know is love
