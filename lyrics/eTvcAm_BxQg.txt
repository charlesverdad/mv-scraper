listen the summers coming slow down dont chase the crowd cause im right here  do you ever wonder why i sing these love songs when i have no love at all is the life you seek made of sins their schemes do you need someone just to cool your blood  or could you ride away from the regrets baby could you dream away all your restless blues could you hide away in the peaceful hours could you dream away in the summer haze  promises i never fail never fail to never make nothing taken nothing spent hell thank me in the end
