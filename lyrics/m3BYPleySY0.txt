such a big a shot feeling the blade as it runs right through your skin such a long way to fall down and on one hand one hand you got me so fired up again take a deep breath sit down these arent the words of a wise man and youd never ever stop you replace growth with stumbling blocks finally found a way to get through it but all the wheels are chalked standings better than falling apart staring in the mirror with blood shot eyes thinking i wouldnt last less a break through would come i made a list of things left for you aiming at myself with a weakened mind said fire when ready till empty only see the worst in me now shoot such a big shot i blame it all on the lack in the will of man and if all hope would be bound such a long race ive kept my eyes on the distance as it stands its crushing my empty hands crushing my empty hands staring in the eyes of weakness like it never ever was you were guessing i would soon give up pulling off the blinders still cant see which way is lost only wishing id find the end there is no fear in love there is no fear in love there is no fear in love you had said that will was never enough i dont want it to be so hard you had said that will was never enough
