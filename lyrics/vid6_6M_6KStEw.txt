you come into the world alone and you go out of the world alone but in between theres you and me oh  ohohohoh ohohohoh ohohohoh  the summer breezes blow so tall and the winter nights are cold and so long in between the falling leaves oh  ohohohoh ohohohoh ohohohoh ohohohoh  the days and nights are killing me the light and dark are still in me but theres an anchor on the beach so let the wind blow hard and bring a falling star ohoh  ohohohoh ohohohoh ohohohoh  ohohohoh ohohohoh ohohohoh
