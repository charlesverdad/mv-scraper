eyes of a child mind of a man  so young to be wild no upper hand  unexplainable anger too strong to hide  afraid to reach out with soul locked inside   my thoughts are my allies all riddled with pain  no selfexpression all shattered the same  lack of attention explodes into rage  leaders misguiding lifes swallowed by fate   now your here looking down watch the world  you are a soul in the sky  now your here looking down cant you see  you are a soul in the sky  now your here looking down incomplete  you lost your soul in the sky   lash out in anger hate turns to steel  no thoughts of redemption no sorrow to feel  why has this happened why loss of life  masses are pointing quick hide the knife   can anyone replace a loss such as this  the young human race so priceless the bliss  for those who are morning a pain that will stay  the price of a lost soul who can repay   now your here looking down watch the world  you are a soul in the sky  now your here looking down cant you see  you are a soul in the sky  now your here looking down incomplete  you lost your soul in the sky   the ones who remain will have to endure  a life filled with heartache an uncloseable door  everyday struggle go on or give in  painful regret that this has no end   what can be done to stiffle the hate  a minutes forever when life is at stake  guiltless killing the children have guns  soul in the sky says the end has begun
