we may never see the sun again we are living til we reach the end kids on the run forever young finding our way back home to you all that we are is falling apart the rest is left to what we choose and after all weve been through on our own this is where i stand all for you the truth as true is stronger more than ever when youre gone i need you more than ever i need you more than ever i need you more than ever falling underneath the rush of lights breathing thunder never undenied two kids in the dark finding their sparks we want to stay so we cant undo all that we are is falling apart the rest is left to what we choose and after all weve been through on our own this is where i stand all for you the truth as true is stronger more than ever when youre gone i need you more than ever i need you more than ever i need you more than ever
