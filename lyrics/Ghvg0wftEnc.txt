feeling the anger inside me im chosen to lose in this game to get me will not be so easy to kill me not even the game  ill send the fight  my pride is victory  there is blood there is pain but my agony is not in vain cause theres life after death and im sure coming back to attack as an angel in black  hiding myself in the city so dark cause its ruled by the ghosts footsteps of iron behind me the sword of the king  i fear most  back in the light  i face my destiny  there is blood there is pain but my agony is not in vain cause theres life after death and im sure coming back to attack as an angel in black
