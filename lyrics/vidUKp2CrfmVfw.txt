ive been standing at the edge of the water long as i can remember never really knowing why i wish i could be the perfect daughter but i come back to the water no matter how hard i try  every turn i take every trail i track every path i make every road leads back to the place i know where i can not go though i long to be  see the line where the sky meets the sea it calls me and no one knows how far it goes if the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me one day ill know if i go theres just no telling how far ill go  oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  i know everybody on this island seems so happy on this island everything is by design i know everybody on this island has a role on this island so maybe i can roll with mine  i can lead with pride i can make us strong ill be satisfied if i play along but the voice inside sings a different song what is wrong with me  see the light as it shines on the sea its blinding but no one knows how deep it goes and it seems like its calling out to me so come find me and let me know whats beyond that line will i cross that line  see the line where the sky meets the sea it calls me and no one knows how far it goes if the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me one day ill know how far ill go
