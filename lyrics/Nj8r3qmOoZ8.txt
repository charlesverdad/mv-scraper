come on in leave the light on  this here beds to big and cold all alone  we can make some inspiration  because i just cant seem to make it on my own    i i dont mind  you can come down down any time  ill ill be just fine  if you come down down any time    you can steal me from the sandman  when its three am and everything seems clear  whiskey choices ill be making  when the sound of your soft voice is in my ear    cause i i dont mind  you can come down any time  i i be just fine  if you come down down any time    we can spend  the days forgeting  and pretend that weve got nothing there to hide  but tonight  ill let you hold me  and in your arms till mornin ill be just fine    cause i i dont mind  you can come down down any time  ill ill be just fine  if you come down down any time
