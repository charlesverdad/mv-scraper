when the days are cold and the cards all fold and the saints we see are all made of gold when your dreams all fail and the ones we hail are the worst of all and the bloods run stale  i want to hide the truth i want to shelter you but with the beast inside theres nowhere we can hide no matter what we breed we still are made of greed this is my kingdom come this is my kingdom come  when you feel my heat look into my eyes its where my demons hide its where my demons hide dont get too close its dark inside its where my demons hide its where my demons hide  at the curtains call its the last of all when the lights fade out all the sinners crawl so they dug your grave and the masquerade will come calling out at the mess youve made  dont want to let you down but i am hellbound though this is all for you dont want to hide the truth no matter what we breed we still are made of greed this is my kingdom come this is my kingdom come  when you feel my heat look into my eyes its where my demons hide its where my demons hide dont get too close its dark inside its where my demons hide its where my demons hide  they say its what you make i say its up to fate its woven in my soul i need to let you go your eyes they shine so bright i want to save that light i cant escape this now unless you show me how  when you feel my heat look into my eyes its where my demons hide its where my demons hide dont get too close its dark inside its where my demons hide its where my demons hide
