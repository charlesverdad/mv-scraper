he laid face down on the desert sand clutching his sixgun in his hand shot from behind i thought he was dead for under his heart was an ounce of lead but a spark still burned so i used my knife and late that night i saved the life of ringo  ringo ringo  i nursed him till the danger passed the days went by he mended fast and then from dawn till setting sun he practiced with that deadly gun and hour on hour i watched in awe no human being could match the draw of ringo  ringo ringo  one day we rode the mountain crest and i went east and he went west i took to law and wore a star while he spread terror near and far with lead and blood he gained such fame all through the west they feared the name of ringo  ringo ringo  i knew someday id face the test which one of us would be the best and sure enough the word came down that he was holed up in the town i left the posse out in the street and i went in alone to meet ringo  ringo ringo  they said my speed was next to none but my lightning draw had just begun when i heard a blast that stung my wrist the gun went flying from my fist and i was looking down the bore of the deadly 44 of ringo  ringo ringo  they say that was the only time that anyone had seen him smile he slowly lowered his gun and then he said to me were even friend and so at last i understood that there was still a spark of good in ringo  ringo ringo  i blocked the path of his retreat he turned and stepped into the street a dozen guns spit fire and lead a moment later he laid dead the town began to shout and cheer nowhere was there shed a tear for ringo  ringo  the story spread throughout the land that i had beaten ringos hand and it was just the years they say that made me put my guns away but on his grave they cant explain the tarnished star above the name of ringo  ringo ringo ringo ringo
