when its good its not bad when its bad i dont mind if youre queer lets be happy while were here  i dont clap i dont cheer i dont look i dont hear its alright i dont mind that youre here its alright  i sit up sip my tears as theyre falling down in my beer  no need to cry at all no need to cry at all no need to cry at all theres no need to cry at all  play the game cup your ears lets be happy while were here  coming coming coming out of your eye i dont mind coming coming coming down from your eye i dont mind  no need to cry at all no need to cry at all no need to cry at all theres no need to cry at all  coming coming coming out of your eye i dont mind coming coming coming out of your eye i dont mind no need to cry at all no need to cry at all
