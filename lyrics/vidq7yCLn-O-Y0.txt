well i woke up to the sound of silence the cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight and i found you with a bottle of wine your head in the curtains and heart like the fourth of july  you swore and said we are not we are not shining stars this i know i never said we are though ive never been through hell like that ive closed enough windows to know you can never look back  if youre lost and alone or youre sinking like a stone carry on may your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground carry on  carry on carry on  so i met up with some friends at the edge of the night at a bar off 75 and we talked and talked about how our parents will die all our neighbors and wives  but id like to think i can cheat it all to make up for the times ive been cheated on and its nice to know when i was left for dead i was found and now i dont roam these streets i am not the ghost you are to me  if youre lost and alone or youre sinking like a stone carry on may your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and carry on  woah my head is on fire but my legs are fine after all they are mine lay your clothes down on the floor close the door hold the phone show me how no ones ever gonna stop us now  cause we are we are shining stars we are invincible we are who we are  on our darkest day when were miles away sun will come we will find our way home  if youre lost and alone or youre sinking like a stone carry on may your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and carry on  on on oh woah oh woah woah no ones ever gonna stop us now no ones ever no ones ever no ones ever gonna stop us now no ones ever gonna stop us now
