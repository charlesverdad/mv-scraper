even if it rains and the sun wont shine sun wont shine whatever the weather youll be mine  all of this noise distracts me fear him now let there be light  through the worst weather ill make sure were together when the sky begins to hail we will prevail  we will prevail  the beauty in the eye of the storm is where i stand when i feel your grace i forget about my pride and my place just take me from here  when the sky turns grey ill pray for a better day a better day  lets watch the rain fall and wash away our innocence in the clouds i hear the chorus sing hallelujah  put the south in your mouth and swallow  we are the herd and he is our sheppard we are the herd and he is our sheppard  he whos without sin cast the first stone  but who are you to judge who are you to judge who are you to judge
