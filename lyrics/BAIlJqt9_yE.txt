swing your arms into a ghost that made a stare alive and i turned my heels and run but they already ran away  i know you saw a smile but you been off the hinge by now the covers blown and everybody is far away  somewhere on the line i could have had the time id be happier with you what else could i do  in the backseat  dear i know we had a while and that was all i have and i roam all over town but now the ghost wont go away  you sink into the sun you left me by the planks and you tell everyone now he is far away  dear im all alone my mind and only kind im happier with you what else could i do  in the backseat with no sign  now my love is dead you were my best friend started in the car ended with my heart  in the backseat the backseat
