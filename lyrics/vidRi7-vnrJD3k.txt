i let it fall my heart and as it fell you rose to claim it it was dark and i was over until you kissed my lips and you saved me  my hands they were strong but my knees were far too weak to stand in your arms without falling to your feet  cause theres a side to you that i never knew never knew and the things youd say they were never true never true and the games youd play you would always win always win  but i set fire to the rain watched it pour as i touched your face let it burn while i cried cause i heard it screamin out your name your name  when i lay with you i could stay there close my eyes feel you here forever forever you and me together nothing is better  cause theres a side to you that i never knew never knew and the things youd say they were never true never true and the games youd play you would always win always win  but i set fire to the rain watched it pour as i touched your face let it burn while i cried cause i heard it screamin out your name your name  i set fire to the rain and i threw us into the flames when we fell something died cause i knew that that was the last time the last time  sometimes i wake up by the door that heart you caught must be waiting for you even now when were already over i cant help myself from looking for you  but i set fire to the rain watched it pour as i touched your face let it burn while i cried cause i heard it screamin out your name your name  i set fire to the rain and i threw us into the flames when we fell something died cause i knew that that was the last time the last time oh  oh no let it burn oh
