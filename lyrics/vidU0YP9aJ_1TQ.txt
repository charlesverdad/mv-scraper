there wasnt much i used to need a smile with glow a summer breeze through my heart now my mistakes are haunting me like winter came and put a freeze on my heart  ive lost the power to understand what it takes to be a man with my heart i saw you wanted this to end you tried your best to be a friend to my heart  but im leaving this worry town please no grieving my love understand  whenever i was feeling wrong i used to go and write a song from my heart but now i feel ive lost my spark no more glowing in the dark for my heart  so im leaving this worry town please no grieving my love understand  understand understand understand understand understand cant you see im sick for you understand cant you tell ive lost my way understand look at me theres no denying understand i wont last another day  so im leaving this worry town please no grieving my love understand  all my dreaming torn in pieces all my dreaming torn in pieces all my dreaming torn in pieces all my dreaming torn in pieces now
