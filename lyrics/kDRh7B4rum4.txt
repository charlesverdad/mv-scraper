i once loved a boy so smart and true we would walk home every day from the school hed say i think we could walk forever oh no how bout just a little while okay he would make me laugh like the devil haha he would pick me up like the child that i was  in my time id like to stay young forever like a tide the crest beneath sunny weather may we fill these lungs with laughter haha and we may shake these bones with style watch me now and may we claim all that were after everything and may we do it wearing a smile and may the breath we breathe be free and for you to remain a part of me three four  i have loved many faces many places all aboard my train but depart at different stations and some of them look the same but none of them smell the same and some of them will never change while some of them are growing strange and some of them are center stage while some of them go and turn my page and some are  and some are diseased with rage oh but all of them are aboard my train but all of them are a friend of mine and oh my darling cant you see oh that babe oh and you are a part of me
