late on a friday my husband went up to the mountains with three friends they took provisions and bottles of bourbon to last them all through the weekend one hundred miles they drove just to fish in a stream and theres so much water so close to home  when they arrived it was cold and dark they set up their camp quickly warmed up with whiskey they walked to the river where the water flowed past darkly in the moonlight they saw the body of a young girl floating face down and theres so much water so close to home  when he hold me now im pretending i feel like im frozen inside and behind my eyes my daily disguise everythings turning to white  it was too hard to tell how long shed been dead the river was that close to freezing but one thing for sure the girl hadnt died very well to judge from the bruising they stood there above her all thinking the same thoughts at the same time theres so much water so close to home  so this is what they did they carried her downstream from their fishing between two rocks they gently wedged her after all theyd come so far it was late and the girl would keep she was going nowhere they stayed up there fishing for two days they reported it on sunday when they came back down theres so much water so close to home  when he holds me now im pretending nothing is working inside and behind my eyes my daily disguise everythings turning to white  the newspapers said that the girl had been strangled to death and also molested on the day of the funeral the radio reported that a young man had been arrested i went to the service a stranger i drove past the lake out of town theres so much water so close to home  when he holds me now im pretending i feel like im frozen inside and behind my eyes my daily disguise everythings turning to white
