i see myself so vividly laid out in a grand salon surrounded by people who mourn and whisper well of me i sleep in silence feel no pain like a child in peaceful slumber free from my body take a wonder around between flowers bought in by the hour aroma incense who are in heaven is sent with tearful eyes whisper my name sad end to the story always meant well but at time was a little weird now at peace free at last from so much fear and painsake so many pointless mistakes so much heartbreak im going to live under a grand marbol crib and in my headstone read a verse youve written for me ooh death and you whereve you gone to where are you are you damed in hell forever or are you in ghosyly pleasures tell me death and you whereve you gone to where are you  are you floating up in heaven or beating back the beast of burden death and you whereve you gone to where are you and so you have now until then the first of november to come and see me wearing black and adorned with flowers you weep a little say a prayer something like a hall mary to keep me safe and sound behind the gates of heaven im scared no more its not so bad round here i know a lot of people i didnt want to live ooh death and you whereve you gone to where are you are you beside me here forever or are your bones whats to left to tether tell me death and you whereve you gone to where are you will you hope be in my dreams or reincarnated once again death and you where are you
