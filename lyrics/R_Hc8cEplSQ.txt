high on a mountain in western montana a silhouette moves cross a cinnamon sky riding alone on a horse he called music with a song on his lips and a tear in his eye  he dreams of a time and a lady that loved him and how he would sing her sweet lullabies but we dont ever ask him and he never talks about her guess it is better to just let it slide  but sang ooh to the ladies and ooh he made some sigh now he rides away on a horse he called music with a pain in his heart and a tear in his eye  he rode the music from boston to bozeman for not too much money but way to much ride but those were the days when a horse he called music could jump through the moon and sail across the sky  now all thats left is a timeold worn cowboy with nothin more than the sweet byandby and trailing behind is a horse with no rider a horse he calls memories that she used to ride  and he sang ooh to the ladies and ooh he damn near made some fall right down and die now he rides away on a horse he called music with a pain in his heart and a tear in his eye  high on a mountain in western montana two crosses cut through a cinnamon sky marking the place where a horse he called music lays with a cowboy in the sweet byandby
