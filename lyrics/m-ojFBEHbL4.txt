as the daylight fades you must go inside cause this is a story of a man in the night  the black sky is closing in on you a child prays she is one of the lucky few  eyes of fire spawned from hell evils here the shadows are alive  in the darkness the victims he will find with piercing eyes he leaves no one behind  eyes of fire spawned from hell evils here the shadows are alive  in the streets he lurks until the dawn a lifeless body it lays on the ground  a chill is in the air the town it lives in fear they must destroy the beast its maker it will meet  oh oh  eyes of fire spawned from hell evils here the shadows are alive eyes of fire spawned from hell evils here the shadows are alive
