im tired of living in your constellation most of your friends they still dont know my name ive never been good at orbiting and everything you say is greek to me so why dont i blow the lid off this can of worms i think there might be a prize at the bottom its a cracker jack deal ill be free and youll be rid of me everythings gold on the surface of the moment but i take my coffee much blacker than you ever will and when my day comes crashing down at 3 am without a sound youre fast asleep but im dying  youre making me laugh but i dont want to laugh anymore people laugh when they dont really know the score and laughing is just one step away from crying and i dont want to do that today a bit of a piece of a fragment of you is enough i can file it away with the last six months in a tattered envelope stuck away in a book that i never read everythings gold on the surface of the moment but i take my coffee much blacker than you ever will and when my day comes crashing down at 3 am without a sound youre fast asleep but im dying  i had a dream last night bout an angel she was laughing at me but so sweetly then she kicked me out the door i fell out of bed and now my ribs are sore everythings gold on the surface of the moment but i take my coffee much blacker than you ever will and when my day comes crashing down at 3 am without a sound youre fast asleep but im dying youre doing fine but im dying
