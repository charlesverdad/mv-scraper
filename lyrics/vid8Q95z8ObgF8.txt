lets make a bonfire i got a blanket in my trunk one blanket and we could wrap it around both of us the lake is beautiful this time of night i wanna listen to your breath while i look at the moon plus plus i got you this overpriced iced latte look at the stars check this out  theres far too many breakup songs and theres not enough songs about the moment we met a lot of words get spread the pain shame and regret and im not holdin my breath for any change to the sketch but i hope to death somebody can sing about the countless times that we found a way to even out even though we were born to work with these hands its in the plan for us to learn the insecurity dance it goes make a party as the method to prevent it im so sorry you reacted so defensive if i could lend an unsolicited suggestion dont even know if id recommend that you paid attention they told me hell never felt so good but i could tell that they only tryna sell some books look yall know that i would help if i could but i was too busy tryna nail myself to some wood theres more songs praising the people we went to prison with than there are praising the people we make children with and i aint saying either one is more legitimate but itd be ridiculous to think that its coincidence shit ill never be the best at this i write songs that im living in welcome to my sweatshirt i think its magnificent that youre presently present thanks for listening appreciate your effort cinderella fit your hand in the glove we on a spaceship crash land from above we on a lazy river fly fishing for love we on a double barrel shot gun hunting for dove life is just a song i hope that its long it starts with hello and it goes till i die if i did know it all id at least attempt to clarify why we try to overemphasize the goodbyes  we try to overemphasize the goodbyes we always overemphasize the goodbyes so just pretend this is a long hello so just pretend this is a long hello you can pretend this is a long hello
