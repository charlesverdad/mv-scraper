so beautiful it hurts oh so bittersweet your love has come to be so blinded that i hide my eyes to see so much to me it gives so deep so deep in me it lives so beautiful it hurts  so tenderly it strikes so gentle are the nails that graze my skin so painful that i beg you to begin so soft and so intense so slow i know i know ive no defense so beautiful it hurts  so to cruel to be so kind to give me love you know i cant refuse give me what i cant afford to lose so much to me it gives so deep so deep in me it lives so beautiful it hurts
