the days are shorter but the nights are long we could fuck in the sun and dance till dawn and all i want is to be your girl  black holes in the skies to the ends of the world put rocks in your pocket take the boat for a whirl and all i want is to be your girl  i wasnt looking for love but she found me i got a lot of control when youre not around me  well theres ghosts in the night and ghosts in my mind and if we quit changing well be left behind but i wont take another chance of screwing it up so i stay where i am but all i want is to be your girl  i wasnt looking for love but she found me and i got a lot of control when youre not around me  the days are shorter but the nights are long we could fuck in the sun and dance till dawn and all i want is to be your girl  well the earths still spinning so ill write this tune wherever youre walking look up at the moon and know i want to be your girl lose yourself when you dream just like when you love just like when you scream i just want i just want i just want to be your girl
