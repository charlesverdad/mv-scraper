as i approach the prime of my life i find i have the time of my life learning to enjoy at my leisure all the simple pleasures and so i happily concede this is all i ask this is all i need  beautiful girl walk a little slower when you walk by me lingering sunset stay a little longer with the lonely sea children everywhere when you shoot at bad men shoot at me take me to that strange enchanted land grownups seldom understand  wandering rainbows leave a bit of color for my heart to own stars in the sky make my wish come true before the night has flown and let the music play as long as theres a song for me to sing and i will stay younger oh i will be younger yes i will stay younger than spring
