see out the door the leaves are falling here in my heart a drumbeat calling walking the line i watch you waiting hoping to see that if i fall i still will rise look in my eyes see how i hunger show me a way to shake the anger  losing the pulse of unseen mysteries the price we pay in moulding our destinies  i listen for you why do you whisper come now feel the fire stars in the sky the rolling thunder colourful clouds are there for everyone to share i know were  losing the pulse of unseen mysteries the price we pay in moulding our destinies  see out the door the leaves are falling  losing the pulse of unseen mysteries the price we pay in moulding our destinies
