im in love with the night every breath of this house creaking im familiar with the cold and the windows and the doors and the sound of my heart beating beating in and out of time  and its such a shame i heard the wind say this morning be still my heart i age by years at the mention of your name what a pity this season you remember me my lover i dont recognize myself im not the man you love behold the hurricane behold the hurricane  i walk around these empty rooms we once moved like the morning silhouettes they haunt this house like a memory haunts me now as if it were a dream as if it were a dream  and its such a shame i heard the wind say this morning be still my heart i age by years at the mention of your name what a pity this season you remember me my lover i dont recognize myself im not the man you love behold the hurricane behold the hurricane  i heard the moon has visions of her nightly i heard the mighty rivers cry out her i saw the heaven and the earth i saw the heavens and the earth cry alone to you  and its such a shame i heard the wind say this morning be still my heart i age by years at the mention of your name what a pity this season you remember me my lover i dont recognize myself im not the man you love behold the hurricane behold the hurricane
