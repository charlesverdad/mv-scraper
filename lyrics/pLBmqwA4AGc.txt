i was there when you fell from the clouds and landed in the desert there was a thunder inside of my heart there was a wonderful pleasure  and like a stallion raised in the rain you rode on the back of my bike i knew from the song that you sang that you were my lover for life  oh theres no time to sleep oh living in a dream  so take me to the paradise in your eyes green like american money you taste just right sweet like tennessee honey  and we can run away swimming in the sunlight everyday oh paradise in your eyes green like american money  so we took to the calico road running from the weather there was a highway inside of her eyes there was a buried treasure  and we got caught in the storm you started flying the kite at the end was the key to my heart you were my lover for life  oh theres no time to sleep oh living in a dream  so take me to the paradise in your eyes green like american money you taste just right sweet like tennessee honey  and we can run away swimming in the sunlight everyday oh paradise in your eyes green like american money  we carved our love in the mountainside we soaked our hearts in the rain and i waited my whole life for you  so take me to the paradise in your eyes green like american money you taste just right sweet like tennessee honey  and we can run away swimming in the sunlight everyday oh paradise in your eyes green like american money
