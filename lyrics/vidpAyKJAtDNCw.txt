look and see react and breathe i feel your life wash over me into it all the moon and the wind and the sky and the mountains i need many nights of tangled dreams unto it all illusions of time reflections unmasking  the more i live the more you die you make your bed then flee the night tension building up inside but i am not alone i am not alone  will decency one day seem much more concrete than all this green we want it all rapture your muse your god and your bounty belief redeems disconnected fractured scenes among us all are prisoners of time and moments in passing  the more i live the more you die you make your bed then flee the night tension eats me up inside but i am not alone  the more you beg the more i bleed and feed off fruit from rotting trees ill scrape the ground and find the key as i am not alone i am not alone  empty thoughts tangled thoughts i am not alone  insect sounds empty fright make your bed ill stay the night find yourself in winter light you are not alone  the more you beg the more i bleed and feed off fruit from rotting trees ill scrape the ground and find the key as i am not alone  the more i live the more you cry how you are alone  make your bed now sleep the night you are not alone  i hope you make it home
