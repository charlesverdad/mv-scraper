the clock strikes one and youre already gone the clock strikes two and it wakes you the light is on and you turn it off and thats the way it is  the day is out but the night goes on fooling yourself into feeling making love to the ceiling and thats the way it is  the light is on and you burn it out the girl is yours and you doubt the light is on and you turn it off and shes a stone cold fox stone cold  youre passing her by and you dont ask why youre in no questions asked still it puts you to the test and are you looking around  the light is on and you burn it out the girl is yours and you doubt the light is on and you turn it off and shes a stone cold fox stone cold
