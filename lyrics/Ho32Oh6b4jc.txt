i thought i saw a girl brought to life she was warm she came around she was dignified showed me what it was to cry you couldnt be that girl i adored you dont seem to know or seem to care what your heart is for but i dont know her anymore  theres nothing left i used to cry my conversation has run dry thats whats going on nothings fine im torn  im all out of faith this is how i feel im cold and i am shamed lying naked on the floor  illusion never changed into something real im wide awake and i can see the perfect sky is torn  youre a little late im already torn im already torn  theres nothing left i used to cry inspiration has run dry thats whats going on nothings fine im torn nothings fine im torn  im all out of faith this is how i feel im cold and i am shamed lying broken on the floor  illusion never changed into something real im wide awake and i can see the perfect sky is torn youre a little late im already torn im already im already torn torn oh torn
