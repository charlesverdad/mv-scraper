i dont even know how i got here but i know that i dont ever wanna leave i feel the aura and i feel the atmosphere the bass is pumping and now i believe  that life is my bass synth i feel the attack now that i have a taste there is no turning back we are moving as one we align with the stars i know nothing can tear us apart  theres something taking over my heart the night is coming out of the dark its like theres no one else in the room cause baby all i see is all i see is you throw my hands up to the sky let the music take me all our senses come alive let the music take me throw my hands up to the sky let the music take me all our senses come alive so happy i could die  heartbeat racing body losing all control baby you keep my feet on the floor you take over the rhythm take over my soul you be dancing leave me asking you for more  that life is my bass synth i feel the attack now that i have a taste there is no turning back we are moving as one we align with the stars i know nothing can tear us apart  theres something taking over my heart the night is coming out of the dark its like theres no one else in the room cause baby all i see is all i see is you throw my hands up to the sky let the music take me all our senses come alive let the music take me throw my hands up to the sky let the music take me all our senses come alive so happy i could die  dont tell me i dont know you i dont know you remember what i told you through these lies  theres something taking over my heart the night is coming out of the dark its like theres no one else in the room cause baby all i see is all i see is you throw my hands up to the sky let the music take me all our senses come alive let the music take me throw my hands up to the sky let the music take me all our senses come alive so happy i could die
