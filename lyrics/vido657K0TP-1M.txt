here and now it ends  we dont remember the first crack but we will all recall the flood there go the edges son but just you wait i never thought that we would go this way  we stand at the edge and watch the whole world crash around our feet  this is more than each of us this will be the end of us now i swear it believe me just one word and welcome home was all we heard through bars we built ourselves theyd already won just one word and welcome home the empty herd she always said i wont believe it  youve found your voice now let me hear it  we left the tyrant now undone drowning at his rivers end we turned our feet to run the words had called us son we knew the world could end by just one  just one word and welcome home was all we heard through bars we built ourselves theyd already won just one word we should have known the empty herd she always said that we would soon forget but theres one word left in the box yet  as stone turns to dust around us this gift to afterthought brings her own weaknesses opening the prison door comes as no consolation to us standing here at the end  there go the edges son  we stand at the edge and watch the whole world crash around our feet  this is more than each of us this will be the end of us now i swear it believe me just one word and welcome home was all we heard through bars we built ourselves theyd already won just one word and welcome home the empty herd she always said i wont believe it  youve found your voice now let me hear it  hope
