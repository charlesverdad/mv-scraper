you never come when you say you will and i over stay my welcome sitting in this windowsill not letting the spiders build  my cornea like a desert now refusing to close their fleshy curtains miss the moment you step in frame  guffman godot please just take your pick the three dollar bill you loaned me lets me buy a fiction find allowing the sap to pine  you never come when you say you will you never come when you say you will you never come when you say you will you never come  you never come when you say you will and you never say youre welcome to this unrelenting phantom made of only face and hands  my tired mind like horizon line and slowly its dawning on me filling in the cracks as lonely masons build  castles and walls ready break em down hurry here comes the ivy anything you want from me is all that youve got from me  you never come when you say you will x12 oh even now x11
