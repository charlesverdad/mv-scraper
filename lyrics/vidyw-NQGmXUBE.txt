if you had an empty suitcase id help you to pack it tight and if you were afraid of darkness well i would stay till it was light  if you were a supermodel i would help you lift your bags id push those paparazzis over so you could get inside your cab  if you found your toothpaste empty i would squeeze out just a little more and if you had the sweetest victory id high five you till our hands were sore  if you were scared and worried i would keep you safe and sound if you were addicted to fabric you could fill a whole room in our house  if we climbed the highest tree top and you said you couldnt climb back down i would build the finest tree house for our new life above the ground  and when you smile at me so sweetly i love what happens in your eyes when they open up to me my darling its all i need and its so right  oh i have got a thousand reasons for you to come away with me the more i look the better you seem and i hope that in your heart you see  cause i believe that you are all i want cause i believe that you and i belong
