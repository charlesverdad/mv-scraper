finger on the trigger well you may as well mention therell be no better time the right times wrong and left behind  doesnt really count if you never come to mention i dont know what you were wanting anyway  so what makes you different from the other billion criminals reminding me of everybody else ive ever known  and you talk and you listen but you never put your finger on the funny little feeling fucking you  you never saw it coming you can color me jealous but im bleeding in a much more original method  youd love to help yourself but youre drowning in illusions youre choking do you need to take a break  cause it can be stopped as easily as it begins if you cant tell the difference then you know youre one of them  so you fall back to seasons and you never break the ice cause your sex is the distortion to the naughty and the nice  you close your eyes to embrace the next puppet in the row i would sympathize but realize i wanna see the show  now you feel so secure cause you never thought to crawl when you dont know what you have is the only time you think you have it all  you have it all  were you expecting a pat on the back you have it all
