i never came to the beach or stood by the ocean i never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand but you brought me here and im happy that you did cause now im as free as birds catching the wind i always thought i would sink so i never swam i never went boatin dont get how they are floatin and sometimes i get so scared of what i cant understand  but here i am next to you the skies so blue in malibu next to you in malibu next to you  we watched the sun go down as we were walking id spent the rest of my life standing here talking you would explain the current as i try to smile hoping i just stay the same and nothing will change and itll be us just for a while do we even exist thats when i make the wish to swim away with the fish is it supposed to be this hot all summer long i never wouldve believed you if three years ago you told me id be here writing this song  but here i am next to you the skies so blue in malibu next to you in malibu next to you next to you the skies so blue in malibu next to you  we are just like the waves that flow back and forth sometimes i feel like im drowning and youre there to save me and i wanna thank you with all of my heart its a brand new start a dream come true in malibu
