my daddy was a soldier in a foreign war but he doesnt like to talk about it any more he kept a picture of my mama right by his heart hed give it one last look before the fighting would start he said all i ask is that you dont forget cause the wars not over when the fighting ends  theres a part of me that will always be just a boy in a hole with an m16 airborne ranger infantry  i left my best friend lying in a pool of blood while i crawled away through the brush and mud if i could choose to go back again id die lying there next to him i still see his face when i close my eyes as i wont forget his sacrifice  theres a part of me that will always be just a boy in a hole with an m16 airborne ranger infantry  vocal  i didnt do it for the money didnt do it for fame i didnt do it so the world would remember my name i did it for my family and my country and my brothers who died right next to me  and all we ask is that you dont forget cause the wars not over when the fighting ends theres a part of us that will always be just boys in a hole with our m16s  honoring souls and memories airborne ranger infantry
