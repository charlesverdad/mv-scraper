burning skies  raining fire down on the helpless below hell has come  storming legions iron eagles  angels of death  searing wings  roar as thunder burning the life right out of the night heavens above  slaughtered outright reducing bodies to ashes and dust  no more tomorrows  sunrise on a dead world burning the shadows right into the walls paying the price in self sacrifice  final breath  ends in fire fallout snows its seeds of death darkened skies  deadly quiet nuclear winter settles its frost pitiful end  human folly centuries of work now scattered to dust victor defeated  final chapter closing the book and set it alight  failsafe  cannot be recalled flee to nowhere  death consumes all return to the earth from which you crawled return to darkness  return to dust
