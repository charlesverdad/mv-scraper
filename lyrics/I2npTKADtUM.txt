in a dream it would seem i went to those who close the open door and turning the key i sat and spoke to those inside of me  they answered my questions with questions and they pointed me into the night where the moon was a starpainted dancer and the world was just a spectrum of light  they reached to my centre of reason and pulled on the touchstone thats there the shock of that light had me reeling and i fell into the depths of despair  turning the key i sat and spoke to those inside of me  they answered my questions with questions and they set me to stand on the brink where the sun and the moon were as brothers and all that was left was to think  they answered my questions with questions and they pointed me into the night and the power that bore me had left me alone to figure out which way was right
