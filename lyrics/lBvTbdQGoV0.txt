another long summers come and gone i dont know why it always ends this way the boardwalks quiet and the carnival rides are as empty as my broken heart tonight  but i close my eyes and one more time were spinning around and youre holding on tightly the words came out i kissed your mouth no fourth of july has ever burned so brightly you had to go i understand but you promised youd be back again and so i wander round this town til summer comes around  i got a job working at the old park pier and every summer now for five long years i grease the gears fix the lights tighten bolts and straighten the tracks and i count the days til you just might come back  and then i close my eyes and one more time were spinning around and youre holding on tightly the words came out i kissed your mouth no fourth of july has ever burned so brightly you had to go i understand but you swore that youd be back again and so im frozen in this town til summer comes around  yeah yeah comes around  oh then i close my eyes and you and i stuck on the ferris wheel rocking with the motion and hand in hand we cried and laughed knowing that earth belonged to us girl if only for a moment baby ill be back again you whispered in my ear but now the winter wind is the only sound and everything is closing down til summer comes around til summer comes around yeah  til it comes around and it comes around
