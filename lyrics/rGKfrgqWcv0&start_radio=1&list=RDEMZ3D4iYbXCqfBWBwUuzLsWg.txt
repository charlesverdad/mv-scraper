well i came home like a stone and i fell heavy into your arms these days of dust which weve known will blow away with this new sun  but ill kneel down wait for now and ill kneel down know my ground  and i will wait i will wait for you and i will wait i will wait for you  so break my step and relent well you forgave and i wont forget know what weve seen and him with less now in some way shake the excess  cause i will wait i will wait for you and i will wait i will wait for you and i will wait i will wait for you and i will wait i will wait for you  now ill be bold as well as strong and use my head alongside my heart so tame my flesh and fix my eyes a tethered mind freed from the lies  and ill kneel down wait for now ill kneel down know my ground woo  well raise my hands paint my spirit gold and bow my head keep my heart slow  cause i will wait i will wait for you and i will wait i will wait for you and i will wait i will wait for you and i will wait i will wait for you
