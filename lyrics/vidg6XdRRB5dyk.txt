i cant fly but i keep finding myself soaring high above this i have nothing left but i keep on pouring out like i am endless  impossible impossible  i dont run too fast but im looking back and miles and miles have passed i can barely breathe but im singing out like this is nothing to me  impossible whoa impossible  every morning i see another miracle i cant believe im living the impossible we are the signage and we are the wonder another day of living the impossible  impossible impossible  i choose to be alive especially because the odds say i should die i wrestle death again i know more of his moves now and i wont give in  impossible whoa impossible  every morning i see another miracle i cant believe im living the impossible we are the signage and we are the wonder another day of living the impossible  when im weak i wonder if im gonna be all right but too many times ive seen this all come to life if i make myself stop and remember  every morning i see another miracle i cant believe im living the impossible we are the signage and we are the wonder another day of living the impossible  im living the impossible we are the signage and we are the wonder im living the impossible  impossible
