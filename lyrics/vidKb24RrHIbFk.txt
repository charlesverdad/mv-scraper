so much on my mind i think i think too much read between these lines unspoken weight of words but time comes to rest when you are by my side it blurs  and i will follow where this takes me and my tomorrows long to be unknown when all is shaken be my safety in a world uncertain say youll be my stone  change in every wind the sands of time dont know our name oh nothings sure but surely as we stand i promise i will stay the same and ive never seen forever but i know well remain  and i will follow where this takes me and my tomorrows long to be unknown when all is shaken be my safety in a world uncertain say youll be my stone  be my stone in a world uncertain say youll be my stone  oh steady me be my source of gravity while me worlds unraveling say youll never change oh oh  and i will follow where this takes me and my tomorrows long to be unknown when all is shaken be my safety in a world uncertain say youll be my stone  be my stone in a world uncertain say youll be my stone
