the ripe age of seventeen moved into the big bad city hoping itd accept me but i didnt care it would make me wise and lean  spent many a sleepless nights dont care if the bedbugs bite a hundred fancy couches but my pillow was the thought of you  a flameless name a foolish game im half crazy and youre too sane  thirty one days in june my only mission was to find you yes i may be tired and im spent but my love will pay the rent  with one shirt on my back my fathers duffel bag and its seen better days just like the youth that was once on my face  a shameless name a foolish game im half crazy and youre too sane  thirty one days in june my only mission was to find you yes i may be tired and im spent but my love will pay the rent my love yeah my love will pay the rent
