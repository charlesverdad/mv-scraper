your eyes behind the door crack  the food tastes like your lips smack  your smell sneaks through the flowers  and tortures me for hours  i switch it on and here we go  your voice come through the stereo  in all these narrow spaces  and all these little places  i see some of your faces  to feel is more or less in vain  the only feeling left is pain  to be awake is useless too  one wouldnt wait for nothing new  not even sleep  is a place to withdrew  in all these narrow spaces  and all these little places  i see some of your faces
