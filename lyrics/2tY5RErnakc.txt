where was i when the rockets came to life and carried you away into the alligator sky even though ill never know whats up ahead im never letting go im never letting go  remember to breathe cause itll take your breath away when the engines cough and you blast off ignite the night with a firecracker flash remember to live cause youre gonna be thrilled to death when the stars collide and your eyes grow wide take it in with your breath against the glass  remember to dream cause its gonna be a starry night over every town as you look down so harmonize with the singing satellites remember to scream cause youre gonna be lost for words when the sparks erupt and they light you up dip your toes in the galaxy cause its yours to explore tonight  where was i when the rockets came to life and carried you away into the alligator sky even though ill never know whats up ahead im never letting go im never letting go  roller coaster through the atmosphere im drowning in this starry serenade where ecstasy becomes cavalier my imaginations taking me away reverie whisper in my ear im scared to death that ill never be afraid roller coaster through the atmosphere my imaginations taking me away  lets hear it for the universe where it never hurts diving in head first take a taste of the melting milky way and remember to laugh cause youre living in a crazy world where youll never guess what could happen next give the outer limits my regards as you float to fly away  where was i when the rockets came to life and carried you away into the alligator sky even though ill never know whats up ahead im never letting go im never letting go  where was i when the rockets came to life and carried you away into the alligator sky even though ill never know whats up ahead im never letting go im never letting go  in the alligator sky never letting go never letting go in the alligator sky  in the alligator sky
