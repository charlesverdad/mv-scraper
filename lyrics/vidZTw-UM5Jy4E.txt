run the lip off sunshine shore betray white water delay dark forms slap young waves on wooden bones dont touch the laughter and away we go  away we go and away we go away we go away we go away we go and away we go away we go away  clap your hands but i feel so lonely clap your hands but it wont do nothing just clap your hands but i have no money just clap your hands but it dont seem like me yeah clap your hands are you up to something clap your hands wheres my milk and honey just clap your hands but i just look funny and clap your hands ill just wait awhile  as time alone stands still for some stuffed sailor up up with eyeball sun and if by castle ship should stray it has like you no chosen fate for its tonguetied caboose that leads this ragged lad this fingerflipping mom and dad  for what is worth some aimless steer and should not confuse my foggy mirror reveal what is not there  i shall take this unbound train and flow away
