im picturing your face with millions of colors just to fill the empty space standing in between our mutual planets  im moving back to your gravitation field  im drifting in and out your gravitation field stuck in between our mutual planets  im picturing your dreams with millions of particles just to feel the curve in space time  im moving back to your gravitation field  im drifting in and out your gravitation field stuck in between our mutual planets  im in the border of your love
