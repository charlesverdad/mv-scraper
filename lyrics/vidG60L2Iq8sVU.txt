just like a rolling stone im outside looking in but if your chance came would you take it where on earth do i begin  im mandy fly me   ive often heard her jingle its never struck a chord with a smile as bright as sunshine she called me through the poster and welcomed me aboard  she led me she fed me she read me like a book but im hiding in the small print wont you take another look and take me away try me mandy fly me away  the world was spinning like a ball and then it wasnt there at all and as my heart began to fall  i saw her walking on the water as the sharks were coming for me i felt mandy pull me up give me the kiss of life just like the girl in dr no no no no  ah when they pulled me from the wreckage and her body couldnt be found was it in my mind it seems i had a crazy dream i told them so but they said no no no no  i found me on a street and starin at a wall if it hadnt have been for mandy her promise up above me well i wouldnt be here at all so if youre travellin in the sky dont be surprised if someone said hi   im mandy fly me
