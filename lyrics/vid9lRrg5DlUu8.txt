i just cant leave it alone ive got to sing this song of my redemption i just cant leave it alone ive left that old life behind i just cant leave it alone  ooh this funky light of my salvation i just cant leave it alone ive got to let it shine  they wont shut me up they aint gonna put me down they think theyve had enough i just cant leave it alone  his loves an ocean and were going under to the bottom of the sea waves will crash against the rocks like thunder and theyre beckoning to me
