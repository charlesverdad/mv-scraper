you must leave now take what you need you think will last but whatever you wish to keep you better grab it fast yonder stands your orphan with his gun crying like a fire in the sun look out the saints are comin through and its all over now baby blue  the highway is for gamblers better use your sense take what you have gathered from coincidence the emptyhanded painter from your streets is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets this sky too is folding under you and its all over now baby blue  all your seasick sailors they are rowing home all your reindeer armies are all going home the lover who just walked out your door has taken all his blankets from the floor the carpet too is moving under you and its all over now baby blue  leave your stepping stones behind something calls for you forget the dead youve left they will not follow you the vagabond whos rapping at your door is standing in the clothes that you once wore strike another match go start anew and its all over now baby blue
