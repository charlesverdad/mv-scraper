i wrestled by the sea a loneliness in me i asked myself for peace and found it at my feet staring at the sea  all that glitters is gold dont believe what youve been told people lie people love people go but beauty lies in every soul  i wrestled by the sea a dream of you and me i let it go from me it washed up at my feet staring at the sea  all that glitters is gold dont believe what youve been told people lie people love people go but beauty lies in every soul  if you wait if you wait for the morning if you wait if you wait for the morning if you wait if you wait for the morning if you wait if you wait for the morning  how long how long how long how long  i asked myself for peace i asked myself for peace i asked myself for peace i asked myself for peace  i asked myself for peace and found a piece of me staring at the sea
