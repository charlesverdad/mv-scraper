im waking up from the same dream ive had before when i close my eyes i miss you even more now im driving 13 hours just to see you smile and i cant wait i cant hold this all inside  it feels like i am wasting all my time when im not with you it feels like i am missing you again  so maybe youll find me waiting unknown and waiting alone i cant take this i wont fake it too many times ive let you go and now im waiting 6 more hours just to see you smile and i cant wait i cant hold this all inside  it feels like i am wasting all my time when im not with you it feels like i am missing you again  waking up is the hardest thing to do when the night before is a thought is a dream is a memory of you  it feels like i am wasting all my time when im not with you it feels like i am missing you again  it feels like i am wasting all my time when im not with you it feels like i am missing you again  and it feels and it feels like im missing you cause im missing you
