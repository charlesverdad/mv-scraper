we were blind and we couldnt conceive the color of blood this crimson flood soaking the ground we stare in shock as the world unveils its true features to us you then exclaim where is god now  you ask me why do we forever feast on pain and act like mindless fiends programmed for boundless rage the carnage never cease the poison is never drained for this should we blame our maker of everything divine  the virtuous dies as well as the sinful one death strikes all life blind in its random ways  in essence we contradict the conception of a watchful shaper and still we consider being observed and closely monitored  primitive we remain we were devised to enjoy trials the choice has never been ours we are inclined to violence
