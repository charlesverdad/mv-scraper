the warriors are sailing away to valhalla and i must also leave upon the rain the orchestra of broken hearts is silent in the dark the feelings in me are all close to pain  i must return the magic ring of eltera the saxon warlord is opening his arms a witch of many shadows is praying for a storm oh but odin predicts it will be calm  the hero lord is also present at the black fjord he speaks in silence at the black fjord the boats are burning at the black fjord  from a thousand years i can see the coming light the fjords echo with the sounds of death the nordic peoples have come so far to say goodbye but im afraid my farewell is without breath  the hero lord is also present at the black fjord he speaks in silence at the black fjord the boats are burning at the black fjord  and so in a boat of flames i sail away to meet the gods and within me my heart is but a stone the magic ring of eltera is now safe again the saxon dead are all going home  the hero lord is also present at the black fjord the boats are burning at the black fjord he speaks in silence at the black fjord let us see him speak to us inside a while the hero lord is also present at the black fjord also present at the black fjord thor and valkyrie can now show the way the saxon dead are all going home
