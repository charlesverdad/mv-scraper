she was so kind to me she sang her little shadow song and i could not resist it bitter blood come sing along  with your hand upon the bible would you swear that is the truth the whole truth and the truth alone  if she had only shut her mouth  shattered memories of quiet cold rejection a careful devils irony in pure perfection in pure deceit  you ask me was it all i had to tell was it all i could recall no then i broke her neck a twisted china white facade i may seem unaffected but dont we all want to be god  is it all you can remember would you swear it on your life  you will never really know my name without reflection a careful devils irony in pure perfection in pure deceit  but in the moment its so beautiful flow along with the hunger with the nature of the beast  these are shattered memories of quiet cold rejection a careful devils irony in pure perfection you will never really know my name without reflection a careful devils irony in pure perfection in pure deceit
