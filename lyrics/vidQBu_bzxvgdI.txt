i feel your racing heart my liquid silver arms extended these waves arent far apart black gold in clawfoot tubs unchanging  i am fire wheres my form whisper crimson i intrude theres light beneath your eyes new overtones in view endless form endless time  if what they say is true you are a shadow in fourth dimension to float away with you we see the corners where nothing happens  while we drifted we were one ceilings lifted walls were gone you speak the language of the breeze all your leaves were meant for me the love that every person wants to be  stuck together i dont like revealing secrets ill live inside your lips if you wont laugh my heaving hands on rotten fruit at last  fallow fingers theres a surface i can count on shed fit inside my heart and take it over till her cape got blown into my red lungs  either theres a purpose or im heading out at breakfast take a drink take a drag one more coffee ugly hat no more mirrors woolen bag and i am gone
