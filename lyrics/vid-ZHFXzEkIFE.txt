at one and the same moment  both thought and mind stayed alike  him he was plainly invisible  she noticed it before a trivial manifestation of gestures  thrown loosely about his shoulders  she said she saw him sadly  in the palm of his hand  they laughed and walked on  they laughed and walked on  till sunlight broke their silence  theyre turning gradually from smile to no smile  theyre turning gradually from smile to no smile  iron in the soul is  prolonged in the case of  a dark and empty window  he leaned his head sideways  she is naked in the  hollow of his gaze he  possessed her angelic  beauty each time fortune  brought him face to face with  something bout to begin  something about to begin  till sunlight broke their silence  theyre turning gradually from smile to no smile  theyre turning gradually from smile to no smile  theyre turning gradually from smile to no smile  la la life goes on  la la la life goes on  life goes on
