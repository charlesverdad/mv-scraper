there was a girl there was a shoreline was an american dream hear her laughing really feels like an american dream  there was a tv turned down still i heard a scream and i woke up from my american dream  how long have i been sleeping how long till i rest in your arms again  there was a white rose and she shone there in an american dream through the rocket red glare of an american dream  through the shut blind the sunshine in a broken beam woke me up from my american dream  how long have i been sleeping how long till i rest in your arms again  i still look for the girl along the shoreline of an american dream the wind on her dress waving the bright flag of an american dream
