when my heart is ready to burst when the world spins in reverse ill keep running to the place where i belong  when you go turn down the light no ones here to hold you in the night ill keep running to the place where i belong  when you think youre on your own im still coming home  when our picture fades in the sun and all the colors blur in the one ill keep running to the place where i belong  when you think youre on your own im still coming home  when your all gets blinded when you fold with the cards no ill never stop fighting to get to where you are  wherever we go wherever we go wherever we go wherever we go wherever we go wherever we go  when the lights are faded to black only stars are guiding me back ill keep running to the place i belong  when you think youre on your own im still coming home when you think youre on your own im still coming home
