im gone the ground is shaking under feels like the world may all come crashing down now your words and sorrys have no meaning baby you lied  you turned it on wasnt my imagination everybody knows that youve been running round so dumb let you play with my emotions baby you lied  if this isnt love what did i feel inside if this aint love how could you look in my eyes cause my heart is breakin not falling this time this cant be love now i know youre a beautiful lie its just a beautiful lie  so cold had me wrapped around your finger part of a show like a puppet on a string how could i know i was just another victim baby you lied  if this isnt love what did i feel inside if this aint love how could you look in my eyes cause my heart is breakin not falling this time this cant be love now i know youre a beautiful lie its just a beautiful lie  i cant stay when i keep falling apart i wont be here waiting lost in the dark now i know its time to let go and i wont take this anymore i dont wanna be lonely but i cant take no more youre just a heartache baby im out that door  cause my heart is breakin not falling this time this cant be love now i know youre a beautiful lie its just a beautiful lie  cause my heart is breakin not falling this time this cant be love now i know its just a beautiful lie
