you and i are nothing but one awkward silence after another and in the canyon where my words should hang there is a graveyard tombstones and ghosts  unheard sentances caked with the thick scent of failed attempts and you are i and i am you sleeping on the clouds and melting in the moonlight  and i might try and fill that canyon with a may i have this dance and the jazz june could sweep you towards my world of sweet romance  but im all out of quarters and the jukebox is spent with its been a good year for the roses careening through the vents so we will sit in my parked car with the engine running low and watch our gullys grow deeper  and i might try and fill that valley with a may i have this dance and the jazz june could sweep you towards my world of sweet romance  and the wave of piano will turn your tide on every three and bring you a little bit closer to me and as the jazz june fills the air around you well just forget about life beyond this breath
