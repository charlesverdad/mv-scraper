warm milk and honey sweeten my teeth from little acorns you you quietly made me made me into me  paper thin skin stretched over my bones from shells and pebbles you you quietly made me made me a home  but i cant get used to being alone and i wont get used to being alone  under a full moon hopelessly trying to retrace our footsteps in the snow i dont know when to hang on and when to let go  foxes in boxes and butterfly blues from little acorns you you quietly made me made me into you  holding it under my tongue till it stings from all of my demons you quietly saved me again and again  but now i feel and surface again yes i can feel and surface again  from little bubbles little air bubbles little embolysms grow i dont know to hang on everything i feel feels wrong i dont know when to hang on and when to let go
