everybody loves the things you do from the way you talk to the way you move  everybody here is watching you cause you feel like home youre like a dream come true  but if by chance youre here alone can i have a moment before i go  cause ive been by myself all night long hoping youre someone i used to know  you look like a movie you sound like a song my god this reminds me of when we were young  let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time that we might be exactly like we were before we realized  we were sad of getting old it made us restless it was just like a movie it was just like a song  i was so scared to face my fears cause nobody told me that youd be here  and i swear you moved overseas thats what you said when you left me  you still look like a movie you still sound like a song my god this reminds me of when we were young  let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time that we might be exactly like we were before we realized  we were sad of getting old it made us restless it was just like a movie it was just like a song  when we were young when we were young when we were young when we were young  its hard to win me back everything just takes me back to when you were there to when you were there  and a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasnt gone i guess i still care do you still care  it was just like a movie it was just like a song my god this reminds me of when we were young  when we were young when we were young when we were young when we were young  let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time that we might be exactly like we were before we realized we were sad of getting old  it made us restless oh im so mad im getting old  it makes me reckless it was just like a movie it was just like a song when we were young
