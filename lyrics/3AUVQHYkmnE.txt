you just figure it out your way you just figure it out your own way because in the end no matter which way or direction this goes youre the only person that can do it  ive gone to hell and back searching for answers that do not exist i tore everything apart needing a reason for feeling like this  it left me with nothing but this hole in my chest so i looked inside to see what id find the true journey begins  i have every bit of faith and confidence that youre gonna find your peace  dont hide the truth inside of you from anyone cause i just cant be what they want me to be can anyone  i made a promise to myself that i intend to keep i made a promise that i will no longer no longer live three feet from peace
