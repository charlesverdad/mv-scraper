its this struggle the weight of the world the decention that begins to curl reeling thoughts of my own devices counter offers for mental prices i cannot falter i will not fail i mend the cracks on these wings i sail steadfast with my own direction its this struggle that bends perfection  i cannot take it i carry on this world has fallen apart i must be strong i cannot take it i carry on this world has fallen apart i must be strong  the edge of doubt its sharp as a knife carving hope off the bones of this life flesh segments of these memories past how much longer until their mind snaps with each scar thicker and longer muilding my strength making me stronger embracing moments that flicker and sway so i can taste the cold steel of day  i cannot take it i carry on this world has fallen apart i must be strong i cannot take it i carry on this world has fallen apart i must be strong  i must be strong strong  i cannot take it i carry on this world has fallen apart i must be strong i cannot take it i carry on this world has fallen apart i must be strong
