can i revise the page of november when she left me behind that old hospital door we all have our stories some are sad to remember some are maddening reminders of who we once were before  but tell me what you see from high above the trees the less that i want the less to remind me that everything wanted is just more to regret saint augustine will you lay your hands on me and heal my head  something unseen something inside me twisted mad like a bull through my bones seeing red i walked all around with a sword pointed toward me asking me if i choose to be alive or dead  but tell me what you see from high above the trees the less that i want the less to remind me that everything wanted is just more to regret saint augustine will you lay your hands on me and heal my head
