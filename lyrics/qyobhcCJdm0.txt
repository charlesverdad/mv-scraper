billy liars got his hands in his pockets staring over at the neighbors knickers down hes got his knickers down  so the summer is eternity for you sleeping in until your fathers shaking you down hes shaking you down  and the mail room shift gets a real short shrift as you dole out the packages noone seems to want you around all skulking around  let your legs loll on the lino till your sinews spoil will you stay here for awhile dear till the radio plays something familiar plays something familiar  all adrifting hes a nogood boyo sent afishing for a whalebone corset frame his only catch all day  so he sits and lets the current take him a gentle breeze will leave his pants in disarray and at his ankles laid  as he drifts to sleep with a moan and a weep he is decked by a japanese geisha with a garland of pearls how she twists and twirls  let your legs loll on the lino till your sinews spoil will you stay here for awhile dear till the radio plays something familiar plays something familiar plays something familiar plays something familiar
