in the stare so in between im feelin bold im in a dream i am a mess i am no god its just the flesh that bend of the stars  when the words get in the way the ones that hurt the ones that she said so i give in to live the beat im givin in to the rhythm of my feet  brush the heat brush brush the heat brush brush the heat brush brush the heat brush  traffic slows the lights are haze and all the smog im in a daze so i move down away from here and if you smile then maybe i could feel  and all the words get in the way the ones that hurt the ones that she said so i give in to let the beat and i give in to the rhythm of my feet  brush the heat brush brush the heat brush brush the heat brush brush the heat brush
