way too old to throw these fits forces greater do exist stomach pains that bring about this feeling of despair focused on the in between fuck this shit its all a dream back and forth distressing me its hard to even care  get in and shut the door what are you waiting for  turn it up i said cause i never get tired of the radio burning through my head the song gets better man every time i hear it so play it when im dead at my funeral so i hear it in the afterlife  in the afterlife  missions still a bit unclear lock the doors and hide in fear pray to god will live to be a thousand but for what everyday i think of this weight it out and take my risks waiting for the chance to say enough has been enough  get in and shut the door what are you waiting for  turn it up i said cause i never get tired of the radio burning through my head the song gets better man every time i hear it so play it when im dead at my funeral so i hear it in the afterlife  feeling rises with the heat its getting harder now to sleep this devastation lost sensation howd this come about then you crawl into my brain but i know im not insane this melody that takes me nowhere  turn it up i said cause i never get tired of the radio burning through my head the song gets better man every time i hear it so play it when im dead at my funeral so i hear it in the afterlife  in the afterlife
