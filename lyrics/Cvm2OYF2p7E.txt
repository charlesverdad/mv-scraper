there is a demon drinking communion wine there is a mockery in the public eye it crossed crossed out every line i see the battleships breaking up the coast here comes the father son but wheres the holy ghost he lined lined up every road  youre bleeding im believing hes selling you lies and death after life  there is a bullet preaching middle eastern skies there is a reason but there is no reason why he stole a million alibis i hear a whisper humming on the urban streets but its so quiet like a disease his crime god save us please  youre bleeding im believing hes selling you lies and death after life  there is some new blood burning kingdom come there is a patriot taking away your freedom there is an old war with a brand new gun there was a righteous man but now hes on the run look out here comes the black ghosts son  youre bleeding im believing hes selling you lies and death after life
