worshipped a deity a false god i praised he had two legs to walk and a smile on his face  he seemed infallible i thought someone this great surely must be from above not from this place  and what a gorgeous view for me i would follow you to anywhere you traveled with a rose in my teeth thought you were a god in skin  but youre only human human you said it all human human by saying nothing at all  well time saw us take the fall but you stayed in one piece cause if you bleed after all it aint over me  baby you let me down and just my blinded eyes are to blame cause who could love still without the power of sight across the sea that holds us in place  so get out of my mind and get out of my heart its only midnight here in arizona but the suns come up where you are i dont blame you for wandering  cause youre only human human you said it all human human by saying nothing at all human human i thought you were so much more
