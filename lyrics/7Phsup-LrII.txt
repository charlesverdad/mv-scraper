i wish we had chances to talk like this a little more often but you were always dealing with your girlfriends shit and i was always feeling broken over it  i like the way your hair looks in the sun and when youre banging into everyone i go to all your shows to watch you play and afterwards i hang out only if you stay  i wish you never got your heart so broke i wish you didnt sleep with her when you were drunk i wish you didnt make out in your friends bedroom cause she wont ever love you like the way i do  and you deserve better yet you think you dont yeah you deserve better than the ones you want you deserve better yet youll never see you deserve better from someone like me
