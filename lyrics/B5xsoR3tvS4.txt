it was the year of the flood it was the hand of god the strength of a monsoon a revolution  i put my hand in the cup drew my name from the mud i had changed it once before but that didnt change things  we still come we still come and we still go but i cant live without you though  i put my face to the glass but its you that stares back i had changed it once before but that didnt change things  the year of the drought it was the hand of god the absence of water made us fearful  after all i could find were the wells of my mind i had changed it once before but that didnt change things  no no evolution no no evolution  i know theres a circle of death and birth but i wont wait and lose you to this big black earth i said  no no evolution no no evolution  i put my hand on your face with your arms to replace the ones that say that we must leave each other one day i said  no no evolution no no evolution no no evolution no no evolution  we still came we still come and we still go
