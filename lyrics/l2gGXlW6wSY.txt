to this day when i hear that song i see you standin there on that lawn discount shades store bought tan flipflops and cutoff jeans  somewhere between that setting sun im on fire and born to run you looked at me and i was done and we were just gettin started  i was singin to you you were singin to me i was so alive never been more free fired up my daddys lighter and we sang sang ooh ooh  stayed there til they forced us out and took the long way to your house i can still hear the sound of you sayin dont go  when i think about you i think about seventeen i think about my old jeep i think about the stars in the sky funny how a melody sounds like a memory like a soundtrack to a july saturday night springsteen  i bumped into you by happenstance you probably wouldnt even know who i am but if i whispered your name i bet thered still be a spark  from back when i was gasoline and this old tattoo had brand new ink and we didnt care what your mom would think bout your name on my arm  baby is it spring or is it summer the guitar sound or the beat of that drummer you hear sometimes late at night on your radio  even though youre a million miles away when you hear born in the usa do you relive those glory days so long ago  when you think about me do you think about seventeen do you think about my old jeep think about the stars in the sky funny how a melody sounds like a memory like a soundtrack to a july saturday night springsteen springsteen  funny how a melody sounds like a memory like a soundtrack to a july saturday night springsteen springsteen whoa springsteen
