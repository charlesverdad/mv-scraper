let us die let us die then dying we reply oh dont you tell us about your suffering now look in our eyes look in our eyes let us be let us be our closeness is such that where ever she rests her head in the softness underneath shell feel me and youll feel me  je leverai les yeux a toi jai change cent foi de nom je leverai les yeux a toi je nai pas despoir  english translation i adjourn thine eyes to thee i changed a hundred faiths of the name i adjourn thine eyes to thee i have no hope  when you laugh youll feel my breath there filling up your lungs and when you cry those arent your tears but im there falling down your cheek and when you say you love him taste me im like poison on your tongue but when your tired if your quiet youll hear me singing you to sleep
