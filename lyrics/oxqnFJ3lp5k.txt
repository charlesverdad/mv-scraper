gotta think think of a time it used to be of all the dreams built inside people dont see whats become of me all they see is fame and money  but i see greed i see wasted life i see me and my life  cause i see greed i see wasted life i see you and your life  gotta think think of a time it used to be of all the dreams built inside of me people dont see whats really true they just look like its their way threw  but i see greed i dont see fame i dont see you i dont see pain  cause i see greed i dont feel you i dont feel threw its not inside  bring up a time it used to be when this pain left inside of me forever thought of my own life thoughts of life thoughts of death forever mine forever in me   lyrics by jordan fanning and sean quigley
