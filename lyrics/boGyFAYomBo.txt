they kicked me out of school cause they said i didnt listen but veronica knew i was heavy into zeppelin i could never get job with a paid vacation  because the records i play are my only education  i turn it up  she hooked me on a line with her walkman and her radio she knew all the records that the other girls didnt know at night i couldnt sleep so i lay there with my headphones on thinking of her eyes while i listen to her favorite song  i turn it up  the guru chants om to shut out the people the choir sings out in the halls of cathedrals they try to find a way to beat the forces of evil  it doesnt matter if shes analog or digital  it doesnt matter if shes analog or digital it doesnt matter if shes analog or digital it doesnt matter if shes analog or digital it doesnt matter if shes analog or digital it doesnt matter if shes analog or digital it doesnt matter if shes analog or digital it doesnt matter if shes analog or digital
