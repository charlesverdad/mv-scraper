i will take this moment with me to the end to the withered light and i wont break like you hoped i would a lost cause to want out  fractured breathing wont last always hoping for the best your intentions were never as good as our dream  i want everyone to know just how hard this is to keep on through the rain and i wont be be reminded of the blackest nights and bleakest days i know  fractured breathing wont last always hoping for the best your intentions were never as good as our dream  the darkest nights dont break our cause the pride we hold to lose will not fall the darkest nights dont change our hearts are we holding our breath were not breaking our hold  withered heart to break through the dark x2 give me strength to fight back to carry on
