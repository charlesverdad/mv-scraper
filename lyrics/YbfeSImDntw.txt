sometimes we fall down cant get back up were hiding behind skin thats too tough how come we dont say i love you enough till its too late its not too late  our hearts are hungry for a food that wont come and we could make a feast from these crumbs and were all staring down the barrel of a gun so if your life flashed before you what would you wish you wouldve done  yeah we gotta stop looking at the hands of the time weve been given if this is all we got then we gotta stop thinking that every second counts on a clock thats ticking gotta live like were dying we only got 86400 seconds in a day to turn it all around or throw it all away we gotta tell em that we love em while we got the chance to say gotta live like were dying  and if you plane fell out of the skies who would you call with your last goodbye should be so careful who we let fall out our lives so when we long for absolution therell be no one on the line  like were dying x4  you never know a good thing till its gone you never see a crash till its head on why we think were right when were dead wrong you never know a good thing till its gone  like were dying x4
