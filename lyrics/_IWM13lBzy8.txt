i saw you inside me and saw me inside you and so i asked you all those things those things that i dont wanna know and cars that are passing are filled with the filth of la the citys on fire and you all have decided to stay  and its so and it goes and it tastes just like this  are you talking back or are you slow falling for those frequent cameos my beautiful blue eyes put on hold gather round like getters on the go  i dare you to cheer me up when i am bored the curious type that i cant afford and folks on their asses will be in your faces next week so damn you or godspeed cause its all the same to me
