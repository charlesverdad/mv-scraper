ive been weeping silent like a wound wont you stitch me up or let the blood soak through watching my world turn from white to maroon ignore my clothes look into my eyes and convince us both that ill last through the night i could land on my feet if i tried i never jumped a chasm so wide and made it to the opposite side  even now as we are standing here i can see the doubt in your eyes i can smell the animal fear i can smell the animal fear  feel my body trembling fur and teeth i wont bite oh did i speak too soon treacherous night that admires the moon and she calls my name and i howl her tune with the hunter slain by the clair of the moon i was braced with my face to the skies but i was not a heavenly child a savage with a temperament wild  even here as we are standing now i can see the fear in your eyes i can taste the sweat i your brow i can smell the animal fear  i can smell the animal fear
