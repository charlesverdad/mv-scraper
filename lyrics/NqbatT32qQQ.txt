it started when we were younger beneath the lead eyes of the city skyline we gave ourselves to the current a surface unswayed in our wake  i rest my head on your shoulder and dreamt we were gone but our names remained felt the pulse of the water and left behind all my old ways  this life could be graced with symmetry walk with me do you walk with me i cant forget the place this started walk with me will you walk with me
