blood lust tonight bite my tongue and hold it in from deep inside she aches for every part of him in the rapture of the midnight sun shes longing for immortal love new moon hangs high tell me will it ever end  here comes the bad rain falling from an aching heart here comes the bad rain dont know when its gonna stop  shes somewhere else should be lying next to me under the spell tangled in her ecstasy from her vein she gave a streaming life let him prey on her like a sacrifice still she denies everything so brazenly  here comes the bad rain falling from an aching heart here comes the bad rain dont know when its gonna stop  and in the madness of this love she wont surrender til its done and so im lost to wait god this night could last forever  and so it ends kisses me and kills the lights the living dead always leave her satisfied  here comes the bad rain falling from an aching heart here comes the bad rain dont know when its gonna stop  here comes the bad rain here comes the bad rain falling from an aching heart here comes the bad rain here comes the bad rain dont know when its gonna stop
