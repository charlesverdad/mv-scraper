what good am i if im like all the rest if i just turned away when i see how youre dressed if i shut myself off so i cant hear you cry what good am i  what good am i if i know and dont do if i see and dont say if i look right through you if i turn a deaf ear to the thunderin sky what good am i  what good am i while you softly weep and i hear in my head what you say in your sleep and i freeze in the moment like the rest who dont try what good am i  what good am i then to others and me if ive had every chance and yet still fail to see if my hands tied must i not wonder within who tied them and why and where must i have been  what good am i if i say foolish things and i laugh in the face of what sorrow brings and i just turn my back while you silently die what good am i
