tell me about the night that she had to take her love away she said it wouldnt work out what reason should she stay when the colour red of loving grows paler every day from red to rose and fading as green grass fades to hay and the dawning shade of nothing seems coloured strangely grey  one two three four  passing through grey  passing through grey  tomorrow perhaps shell change her mind and stay passing through grey passing through grey  see the things that worked between us one time were made of gold no use to try and reach back and change the new for old where once there was just calm mist i start to feel a breeze the pastoral thoughts of sunshine slowly start to freeze as memories of our life together bring me to my knees  two three four passing through grey passing through grey  tomorrow perhaps shell change her mind and stay passing through grey passing through grey  baby oh baby listen to me baby baby listen to me dont take the colour out of my life dont take the colour away i guess i have to be strong now oh yeah oh oh oh baby i dont i dont i dont feel strong baby i dont think i can make it oh please dont go away  passing through grey passing through grey tomorrow perhaps shell change her mind and stay passing through grey passing through grey passing through grey passing through grey passing through grey passing through grey passing through grey
