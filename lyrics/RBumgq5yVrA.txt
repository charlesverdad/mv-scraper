dont slam the door on your way out dont leave without saying goodbye another long distance night alone you leave me wanting always leave me wanting more  last word today youre coming home to stay wouldnt that be nice for a while  but now my takeout food is growing cold and the candles burned a hole in the floor and im still waiting for the ring of the phone  im all alone its just another rainy night without you guess ill leave the light on for you its just another rainy night without you  listen theres a foghorn blowing on the coast tonight remember making love in the rain strange how laughter looks like crying with no sound raindrops taste like tears without the pain  im not much without you cant leave if i wanted to maybe thats why you stay around  but tonight ill sit here tending the fire and pace the floor one hundred times in an hour and check the voicemail for a message youve called you have no new messages in your mailbox  im all alone its just another rainy night without you waiting by the phone alone its just another rainy night without you guess ill leave a light on for you  i know ive said it before hate the sound of the closing door and your footsteps walking away  but now my takeout food is growing cold and the candles burned a hole in the floor and im still waiting for the ring of the phone  im all alone its just another rainy night without you waiting by the phone alone and its another rainy night without you guess ill leave a light on for you  its just another rainy night its just another rainy night its just another rainy night without you
