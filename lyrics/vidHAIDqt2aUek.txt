a tape recorder a length of rope lack of focus shred of hope a piece of thread is all that holds this ship together in this room you lost your heart document and catalogue think of how the past gets bogged down underneath your feet always underneath your feet turn this off when it starts to sounds familiar it will always be incomplete but no one can say that maybe someday your prayers wont be answered rewind take her word shes always right shes always there on your darkest night you must go on what else is there for you to do now when you think youve lost my way shell hide the razors draw the shades youll try to find the last good memory you once had turn this off when it starts to sound familiar it will always be incomplete but no one can say that maybe someday your prayers wont be answered rewind im sorry i didnt get to see you im sorry i didnt keep in touch my friend ive been missing you very much but you know it goes away if you give it time
