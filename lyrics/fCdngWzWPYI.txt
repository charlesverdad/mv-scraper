intro music by david paich lyrics and music by james seals and dan seals 1974 from the albums unborn child 1974 and lift up your voices and sing vol 3 1997  windflowers my father told me not to go near them he feared them always said they carried him away windflowers i couldnt wait to touch them to smell them i held them closely now i cannot break away  their sweet bouquet disappears like a vapor in the desert take a warning son  windflowers their beauty captures every young dreamer who lingers near them ancient windflowers i love you
