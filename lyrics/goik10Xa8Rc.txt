as i went awalkin on a fine summers mornin the birds on the bushes did whistle and sing the lads and the lasses in couples were sportin then back to the factory their work to begin  i saw one among them she was fairer than any her cheeks like the roses that bloom in the spring her skin like the lily that grows in yon valley she was only a hard workin factory girl  i stepped up to her more closely to view her when on me she cast a look of disdain saying young man stand off me and do not come near me i work for my living and think it no shame  the next morning i was there ready and waiting and begged her to talk to me just for a spell and each morning after she lingered still longer and then hurried away at the sound of the bell  then came the morning when silence did greet me the birds on the bushes were stricken and still so i stepped on the path where she often did meet me and i walked to the factory up on the hill  the crowd gathered round couldnt hide the destruction i cast my eyes on it in such disbelief a truth of the world settled into the ashes the rich mens neglect is the poor mans grief  as i stood there a whisper it did caress me a faint scent of roses my senses begun i lifted my face and i saw that above me a thousand young butterflies darkened the sun
