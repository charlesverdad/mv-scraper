oh my god my spreading wings are falling over everyone and gravity is pulling harder every day cheques and balances cheques and balances i need some overhead room to think that they are watching us  this is an echo and you are my sorrow and if you want me you know where to find me this is an echo  the economical arithmetic of autobiographical information that im feeding you is priceless its unofficial but i miss you in a brilliant way well all shine on well all shine on and on and on  this is an echo and you are my sorrow and if you want me you know where to find me this is an echo
