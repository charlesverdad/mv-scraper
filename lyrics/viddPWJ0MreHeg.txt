how could i have known the god of my youth would come crashing down on my heart i thought that i knew love that love was a scornful thing that fed on a fading flame that held the world together for me and when it died i fell apart  the day we met there was a new fire whose heart had been drowning for so long when i was dark you found a glowing ember and set my world into a blaze again  how could i forget you saw the stars in me when i had sunk into the black you never thought to leave you were the drug to bring me out from a crushing sleep you told me all you saw was diamonds you told me that till i believed  the day we met there was a new fire whose heart had been drowning for so long when i was dark you found a glowing ember and set my world into a blaze again  and set it all ablaze and set it all ablaze again you set it all ablaze you set it all ablaze again  you set my heart ablaze you set it all ablaze again when i was dark you set my heart ablaze you set my heart ablaze again  the day we met there was a new fire whose heart had been drowning for so long when i was dark you found a glowing ember and set my world into a blaze again
