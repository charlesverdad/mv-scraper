i remember looking right into the eyes of an angel the evil in me sleeps from time to time wash away these poisons from my mind right on to your skin all the hearts that youve destroyed never stepping from your throne when all the smiles break away truths of the past you cant let go and you are alone today tell me do you feel the same yeah do you feel the same now and this my friends is a moment for all of us to remember how good it felt not to be afraid what its like not to be afraid this time this is for the day you changed my life out in commack open your mouth wider wider wider who knew the truth could hurt so much
